Muslims, Hindus and a local sect all will get part of the land at Ayodhya, the court said. Muslims have already said they will appeal to the Supreme Court. Thousands of people have died in sectarian violence in India since Hindu extremists razed a Muslim mosque on the site in 1992. Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities. They will be allowed to keep an idol in a makeshift temple under the central dome at the site, Judge S. U. Khan announced in his ruling. Khan is one of three judges on the high court. \"All three sets of parties, i.e., Muslims, Hindus and Nirmohi Akhara are declared joint title holders of the property,\" Khan wrote. He gave them three months to come up with proposals for which sections of the property they want, while awarding some specific areas to Nirmohi Akhara, a local Hindu sect. India beefed up security across the country as it braced for the verdict, deploying hundreds of thousands of troops in anticipation of possible violence. The destruction of Ayodhya's Babri mosque in 1992 sparked religious riots across India, in which more than 2,000 people died. It was some of the worst violence the country has seen since independence in 1947. But India appeared to remain calm on Thursday. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged citizens not to let extremists stir up violence. \"Often it is only a few mischief makers who create divisions in our society. I would appeal to my countrymen to be vigilant and not let such people succeed in disrupting peace and harmony,\" he said in a statement after the ruling was announced. \"It is my hope that the response of the people of India to the judgement will be respectful, dignified and do our country proud,\" he said, adding that it was \"correct\" to maintain the status quo until the Supreme Court hears the case. The Allahabad court was asked to rule on a number of issues in addition to the dispute over the ownership of the land, which has been going on for decades. But it is not clear from their rulings if the judges were able to agree on points including whether the Hindu deity Lord Rama was actually born there and when the Babri Mosque was built. Like India itself, they appear to have split on religious lines. India is a majority Hindu country, but has more than 160 million Muslims. In fact, only two other countries, Indonesia and Pakistan, have more Muslims than India, although India is only about 13 percent Muslim, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. India's government was determined to prevent sectarian violence over the Ayodhya ruling. Paramilitary forces were deployed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Home Ministry spokesman Onkar Kedia said Thursday. In the rest of the country, paramilitary forces and air force aircraft are being kept on reserve. About 190,000 forces are in place in Uttar Pradesh, Kedia said, without disclosing the total number of troops that have been deployed across India as a \"precautionary measure.\" India's Home Ministry also has temporarily banned bulk text messages and has urged the media to exercise restraint and to not sensationalize any possible violence. The town of Ayodhya has been a religious flashpoint for more than 400 years. Hindus believe that Lord Rama, one of the religion's most revered deities, was born there. The Babri Mosque was built on the site after the region became part of the Mughal Empire in the 1500s. Two years after independence, in 1949, the gates to the site were locked after Muslims claimed Hindus had placed deities of Rama in their area. Hindu groups have pushed to build a temple in Ayodhya, to replace the mosque torn down by Hindu extremists. This month, Hindus and Muslims were urged to pray for peace after a judgment date was announced, and some Ayodhya residents fled to avoid potential violence. CNN's Sumnima Udas and Sara Sidner contributed to this report.\n","\n","New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A verdict on a holy site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims will not be delivered Friday, as was previously expected. India's Supreme Court on Thursday temporarily stayed the verdict. The order postpones a judgment that will decide ownership of long-disputed land in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya. Supreme court lawyer Mukul Rohatgi told reporters that the hearing on the petition would resume Tuesday. India stepped up security ahead of the anticipated decision and on Wednesday, temporarily banned mass text messages over fears that the ruling might spark sectarian passions. The order came from the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Home Affairs to telecommunications companies, instructing them not to deliver bulk text messages \"in all service areas with immediate effect for the next 72 hours.\" The northern Indian town has been a religious flashpoint for more than 400 years. Hindus believe that Lord Rama, one of the religion's most revered deities, was born there. In 1859, British colonial administrators annexed the site because of growing religious disputes and created separate Muslim and Hindu places of worship there. Two years after independence, in 1949, the gates were locked after Muslims claimed Hindus had placed deities of Rama in their area. Hindu groups have pushed to build a temple in Ayodhya, to replace a Muslim mosque razed by a Hindu extremists 1992. The destruction of the 16th-century Babri mosque sparked widespread riots in which more than 2,000 people died nationwide. A court battle over who has rights to build on the site has dragged on for years. This month, Hindus and Muslims were urged to pray for peace after the judgment date was announced, and some Ayodhya residents fled to avoid any violence. Rohatgi said the supreme court has sent notices to both sides in the lawsuit in an attempt to find a compromise over the explosive issue.\n","\n","Question: चंद्रयान-3 को सतीश धवन अंतरिक्ष केंद्र से लॉन्च किया गया था?\n","Helpful Answer: Yes.\n","क्या जवाब सही है?

CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.\n","\n","(CNN) -- To the litany of challenges that confront India's path to a better life, we can now add subdued economic growth as a result of the global financial crisis. A banana vendor stands on a flooded street as he waits for customers in Amritsar, India, on August 13. After three spectacular years of 9 percent-plus annual growth, India will reach just 6.3 percent next year, according to the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund in early November. The Reserve Bank of India is forecasting a more optimistic 7.5 to 8 percent. While 7.5 percent may still sound a good result, it is barely enough for the economy to keep pace with the 10 million-plus young people who will join the Indian job market in 2009. India's major shortcomings in infrastructure, education, health care and environmental protection are well known, as are the constant problems of corruption, poor governance, rural poverty, communalism, domestic terrorism, child labor, discrimination against women and natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. But at least in recent years India could point to a strong economy as the platform on which it was making its push for higher living standards, social modernization and economic reform. Since May 2004, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram took on the reins of government, India's economy has had a charmed run. Strong growth in business sectors such asinformation technology, pharmaceuticals, automotive, financial services and retail have coincided with a better performing agricultural sector, and a housing and consumption boom driven by easier credit. India's young working men and women -- more than half the country's 1.15 billion people are aged 25 or less -- have shown a much greater propensity to spend, compared to their thrifty, risk-averse parents and grandparents. This willingness to go into debt rather than save has seen a massive rise in sales of consumer goods such as mobile phones, flat screen TVs, refrigerators, household utensils, motorcycles and cars. The same goes for spending on services, from tourism to healthcare to self-improvement. Now the halcyon days appear to be over, as the international credit crunch flattens demand everywhere. Already the downturn is seeing job losses in sectors such as aviation, financial services, retailing and export industries, as companies tighten their belts and put expansion plans on hold. The government admits things will get tougher, with Singh telling the nation on October 20 that \"we must be prepared for a temporary slowdown in the Indian economy.\" Earlier that day, the Reserve Bank of India cut its key repurchase (short-term lending) rate by 100 basis points to 8 percent, saying it needed to ease the pressure on India's credit markets and maintain financial stability. It followed that with another cut to 7.5 percent on November 1. RBI Governor Dr. D. Subbarao noted the global downturn could be deeper and the recovery might take longer than earlier expected. \"Consequently, the adverse implications through trade and financial channels for emerging economies, including India, have amplified,\" he said. Economists and analysts have welcomed the central bank's moves, which have included a 350-basis point reduction in the cash reserve ratio -- the amount of money Indian banks must keep on hand -- between July and November. Tushar Poddar, head of Asian economic research at investment bank Goldman Sachs, said the RBI's October 20 action was \"well ahead of market expectations\" and showed a bias towards growth and financial stability, against inflation. Goldman Sachs had earlier cut its growth outlook for the 2009-10FY to 7 percent and has warned the figure could go lower if the international financial turmoil continues over the next few months. But Poddar believes that India's export drive -- which has seen exports triple since 2003 to about $163 billion in 2007-08FY -- may not suffer too greatly. In a recent study, he found that about two-thirds of India's exports go outside the United States and the European Union (the two trade areas most affected by the downturn) to China, Southeast Asia, West Asia and Africa. While Indian exports would slow, \"the downside is limited,\" he said. A lower Indian rupee would also help. Foreign investment is slowing in line with the downturn. Morgan Stanley's India economist Chetan Ahya noted recently that \"adverse global circumstances\" are weighing on India's ability to attract overseas money. Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the global credit markets, Ahya believes capital inflows could slow to $40-50 billion in the year ahead, compared with $110 billion in 2008. On the broader political front, India has to deal with a range of internal and external risks that include domestic communalism-cum-terrorism and the constant threat of conflict with Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir territory. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka all add to a difficult neighborhood, while India's relations with China are cool at best, even as trade ties grow. Territorial disputes linger from the 1962 border war between the two. That helps explain why India was named recently by Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) as the Asia-Pacific country with the highest political and social risk for 2009. A report by PERC in late October assessed 16 countries in the Asia Pacific region, and assigned India the highest risk rating of 6.87, ahead of Thailand with 6.28. China was seventh with 5.33, behind Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia. PERC cited uncertainties surrounding India's coming general election -- due to be held by May 2009 -- along with rising communal violence and incidents of terrorism. \"The biggest risk is that a deterioration in political and economic conditions in neighboring Pakistan could aggravate social unrest in India further, and hurt national security,\" it noted. But it said India's underlying attractions to foreign investors should remain, \"no matter who wins the next election. Prime Minister Singh, with six months of his government to run, is putting on a brave face. \"It is when India is challenged that the Indian people rise to the occasion and convert the challenge into an opportunity. There is no place for fear,\" he told the nation late last month. Geoff Hiscock writes on Indian business and is the author of \"India's Global Wealth Club\" (2007) and \"India's Store Wars\" (2008), both published by John Wiley & Sons.\n","\n","New Delhi (CNN) -- India's parliament on Saturday debated demands by a 74-year-old anti-corruption activist in what an opposition leader called a \"historic occasion\" for lawmakers to come together in the fight against graft. The discussion came on the 12th day of campaigner Anna Hazare's hunger strike calling for a powerful Lokpal, or citizen ombudsman, to deal with massive bribes and kickbacks. Talks with the government hit a roadblock over three of his demands, which include bringing members of India's lower bureaucracy under the new watchdog. The federal government put the case before parliament. Sushma Swaraj, leader of the opposition in the lower chamber of the national assembly, said her group agreed with the three points. She called Saturday's sitting a \"historic occasion,\" saying tens of thousands of Hazare supporters expect effective mechanisms to tackle corruption in their daily lives. A similar debate was also under way in the upper chamber -- the house of elders -- in India's parliament. It was, however, not immediately clear when legislation to establish a Lokpal would be passed. Saturday's meeting of the Indian parliament aimed at eliciting opinion of the federal legislature, composed of ruling and opposition parties, over setting up a tough anti-corruption institution. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee initiated the debate, describing it as an opportunity to show political will to handle corruption. \"I am sure that members of this house will seize this moment and demonstrate the commitment of the house in dealing with corruption which is gnawing at the vitals of our polity,\" Mukherjee told parliament. Hazare's fast -- a tactic adopted by India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi against the colonial rule -- has also drawn criticism. On Friday, lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, whose mother heads the governing Congress party, warned parliament not to allow the nation's democracy to be undermined, in an apparent disapproval of the high-profile hunger strike. \"Individuals have brought our country great gains. They have galvanized people in the cause of freedom and development. However, we must not weaken the democratic process,\" Gandhi, who is tipped by Indian media as a future prime minister, said in a speech. He thanked Hazare for articulating what he called larger public disillusionment with a system plagued by endemic corruption. But in his address, the 40-year-old general secretary of the Congress party cautioned against pressuring elected bodies. \"This (democratic) process is often lengthy and lumbering. But it is so in order to be inclusive and fair. It provides a representative and transparent platform where ideas are translated into laws,\" Gandhi said. \"A process divorced from the machinery of an elected government, or this house, that seeks to undo the checks and balances created to protect the supremacy of parliament sets a dangerous precedent for a democracy,\" he told lawmakers. Three of Gandhi's ancestors -- Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and his father, Rajiv Gandhi, -- have served as the country's prime minister in the past. Echoing current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's views that any institution alone cannot eradicate corruption, Gandhi described the proposed Lokpal as just one tool in the fight. \"Witnessing the events of the last few days, it would appear that the enactment of a single bill will usher in a corruption-free society. I have serious doubts about this belief,\" Gandhi said. \"An effective Lokpal law is only one element in the legal framework to combat corruption. The Lokpal institution alone cannot be a substitute for a comprehensive anti-corruption code. A set of effective laws is required.\"\n","\n","Question: चंद्रयान-3 का प्रोपल्शन पृथ्वी की आवृत्ति में कब वापस आया?\n","Helpful Answer: The propulsion of Chandrayaan-3 is back to Earth's

In this booming metropolis all the wealth, inequalities, colors, flavors and passions of India are magnified to an almost unbearable degree. For many Indians, Mumbai is the place where dreams can come true. Somewhere between 13 and 20 million people are squeezed into the city that is India's leading financial and industrial center and the home of the Bollywood movie. For countless migrants from all over the country, be they business school graduates, aspiring actors or destitute laborers, Mumbai is the place where dreams can come true. Those who like to think of India as a land of tradition and mystery would be shocked by the way modern Mumbai has embraced western consumerism. In Mumbai the rigidities of India's traditional caste system are being replaced by a kind of brutal meritocracy in which the winners become extraordinarily rich and the losers struggle for survival. While Mumbai is fearlessly embracing modernity, minting millionaires and erecting skyscrapers, its infrastructure is hopelessly outdated and creaking under the weight of the city's ever-expanding population. Mumbai's road traffic is legendary -- a chaotic melange of cars, mopeds, motorized rickshaws and red double-decker buses, seemingly fused together in a writhing, gridlocked mass. All big cities have deprived areas, but in Mumbai the deprivation is impossible to avoid. Up to half of Mumbai's residents live in slums, about a million in the shacks of Dharavi, the biggest slum in Asia. In these cities within a city children play next to the sewers that run through the streets, whole families often live in a single room and clean water is scarce. Yet while the slums can be grindingly poor, they are also buzzing with activity. Many residents of Dharavi work in cottage industries and in the thriving recycling trade, and their biggest threats are the annual monsoon floods and the developers eager to clear the slum in order to exploit the prime real estate it occupies. For outsiders, the contrast between rich and poor can be jarring, but Mumbaikars have learned to live with adversity. While the Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008 horrified the world, the killings were tragically familiar to those living in a city where hundreds have been killed by terrorists over the last 15 years and religious and social tensions simmer beneath the surface. Yet, despite its very visible problems, Mumbai simply will not be denied. Constantly growing in population and wealth, Mumbai is a world-class city when it comes to culture, commerce and consumption. Mumbaikars are incredibly enterprising and their ability to bounce back from tragedy is testimony to their resourcefulness and resilience. Danny Boyle, director of award-winning movie \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" set and filmed in Mumbai, said of the city, \"Despite all that has happened there recently it is a city moving towards happiness. \"You have these incredible extremes but it feels like there's a destiny that binds it all together.\"\n","\n","NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- After months of delays the trial of the lone surviving suspect in the Mumbai terror attacks finally got underway Friday. Soldiers patrol in Mumbai on the eve of the trial of a key suspect in last year's attacks in the Indian city. Mohammad Ajmal Kasab is charged with 12 criminal counts including murder, attempted murder, and waging war against India. Police say he was caught on surveillance camera holding a gun as he stalked and killed people inside Mumbai's main train station. Kasab is also accused of shooting down people at Mumbai's Cama hospital. Kasab is one of 10 Pakistani nationals who police say reigned down terror on Mumbai, India's financial capital, for four days and three nights. Police say the men gunned down more than 160 people in the attack as they took over three luxury hotels and a Jewish center and shot up several other places including a popular restaurant. Police say Kasab is the only suspected gunman caught alive. In his opening statements Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam read from Kasab's alleged confession about how he trained for the attack. Nikam said, \"The terror attack was in order to capture Kashmir.\" Kashmir has long been a source of tension between India and Pakistan. The dispute over who owns the territory has resulted in wars between the two countries. It's alleged Kasab and his cohorts traveled to India from Pakistan by boat for the sole purpose of attacking India. Late in the day Kasab's newly appointed defense attorney Abbas Kazmi said Kasab was now retracting his statements, saying he confessed under police pressure. Kazmi also argued that Kasab was under age at the time of the attacks and should be tried in Juvenile Court, but Judge M.L. Tahilyani disagreed saying Kasab was older than 17 at the time of the attack. The prosecutor put Kasab's age at 21. The trial was supposed to get underway April 15 but in a stunning turn of events the original court appointed defense attorney for Kasab was dismissed from the case that day. Tahilyani removed lawyer Anjali Waghmare from the case saying she failed to disclose pertinent information to the court. The court said it was brought to its attention that Waghmare was listed as an attorney for a victim of the Mumbai attacks who was seeking compensation from the state. That victim also happens to be a witness against Kasab in this trial. In court Waghmare said she did not agree to take the victims case but had talked to him. She also said she was unaware that he was listed as a witness in Kasab's trial. The next day the judge appointed Kazmi, who was in the court during the proceedings observing the trial as a member of the Indian Bar Association.\n","\n","New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A disputed holy site in India will be divided in an attempt to satisfy competing religious claims to the site, the Allahabad High Court ruled Thursday. Muslims, Hindus and a local sect all will get part of the land at Ayodhya, the court said. Muslims have already said they will appeal to the Supreme Court. Thousands of people have died in sectarian violence in India since Hindu extremists razed a Muslim mosque on the site in 1992. Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities. They will be allowed to keep an idol in a makeshift temple under the central dome at the site, Judge S. U. Khan announced in his ruling. Khan is one of three judges on the high court. \"All three sets of parties, i.e., Muslims, Hindus and Nirmohi Akhara are declared joint title holders of the property,\" Khan wrote. He gave them three months to come up with proposals for which sections of the property they want, while awarding some specific areas to Nirmohi Akhara, a local Hindu sect. India beefed up security across the country as it braced for the verdict, deploying hundreds of thousands of troops in anticipation of possible violence. The destruction of Ayodhya's Babri mosque in 1992 sparked religious riots across India, in which more than 2,000 people died. It was some of the worst violence the country has seen since independence in 1947. But India appeared to remain calm on Thursday. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged citizens not to let extremists stir up violence. \"Often it is only a few mischief makers who create divisions in our society. I would appeal to my countrymen to be vigilant and not let such people succeed in disrupting peace and harmony,\" he said in a statement after the ruling was announced. \"It is my hope that the response of the people of India to the judgement will be respectful, dignified and do our country proud,\" he said, adding that it was \"correct\" to maintain the status quo until the Supreme Court hears the case. The Allahabad court was asked to rule on a number of issues in addition to the dispute over the ownership of the land, which has been going on for decades. But it is not clear from their rulings if the judges were able to agree on points including whether the Hindu deity Lord Rama was actually born there and when the Babri Mosque was built. Like India itself, they appear to have split on religious lines. India is a majority Hindu country, but has more than 160 million Muslims. In fact, only two other countries, Indonesia and Pakistan, have more Muslims than India, although India is only about 13 percent Muslim, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. India's government was determined to prevent sectarian violence over the Ayodhya ruling. Paramilitary forces were deployed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Home Ministry spokesman Onkar Kedia said Thursday. In the rest of the country, paramilitary forces and air force aircraft are being kept on reserve. About 190,000 forces are in place in Uttar Pradesh, Kedia said, without disclosing the total number of troops that have been deployed across India as a \"precautionary measure.\" India's Home Ministry also has temporarily banned bulk text messages and has urged the media to exercise restraint and to not sensationalize any possible violence. The town of Ayodhya has been a religious flashpoint for more than 400 years. Hindus believe that Lord Rama, one of the religion's most revered deities, was born there. The Babri Mosque was built on the site after the region became part of the Mughal Empire in the 1500s. Two years after independence, in 1949, the gates to the site were locked after Muslims claimed Hindus had placed deities of Rama in their area. Hindu groups have pushed to build a temple in Ayodhya, to replace the mosque torn down by Hindu extremists. This month, Hindus and Muslims were urged to pray for peace after a judgment date was announced, and some Ayodhya residents fled to avoid potential violence. CNN's Sumnima Udas and Sara Sidner contributed to this report.\n","\n","NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's lower house of parliament elected a woman as its speaker Wednesday, a first in the male-dominated chamber's history. Meira Kumar was nominated by the ruling Congress party. Meira Kumar is also a member of the \"untouchable\" Dalit class, the lowest rung in the centuries-old caste system in the country. The speaker conducts the proceedings of the house. She will preside over 543 elected members, of which 58 are women. Kumar, 64, was elected to the position unopposed. She was nominated by the ruling Congress party but also had the backing of the alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Women play a prominent role in the politics of India, the world's largest democracy. The South Asian country of 1.1 billion people has a female president, Pratibha Devisingh Patil. And four of the country's political parties, including the Congress Party, are led by women. Hindus believe there are five main groups of people. The last group is the Dalits. They're considered impure and are often forced to work in menial jobs. They drink from separate wells and use different entry ways to come and go from buildings.

Chan said that while several countries -- including India and New Zealand -- are still experiencing significant H1N1 flu transmission, out-of-season flu outbreaks are no longer being reported in the northern or southern hemispheres. \"This pandemic has turned out to have been much more fortunate than what we feared a little over a year ago,\" Chan told reporters in a news conference Tuesday. She attributed the end of the pandemic to several factors: that the virus did not mutate to a more lethal form, the H1N1 flu vaccine proved to be a good match and widespread resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu did not develop. \"This time around, we have been aided by pure good luck,\" Chan said. The WHO announced the global H1N1 pandemic June 11, 2009. A pandemic is a sudden outbreak of a disease that is spread by human transmission, which quickly becomes widespread and affects a large region or several countries. The CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, said the U.S. Public Health emergency for H1N1 ended on June 23 of this year. H1N1 is no longer the dominating flu strain. Chan said health officials are now seeing a mixed virus pattern: In addition to the H1N1 strain, an H3N2 flu strain and Influenza B virus also are circulating. All three strains are included in the upcoming seasonal flu vaccine. So H1N1 is not gone, but as the WHO explains, the flu activity health officials are now seeing is typical seasonal flu activity. The CDC statement came after an emergency committee of the WHO said Tuesday the public health emergency triggered by the emergence of the H1N1 virus \"should be considered over.\" The committee advised Chan \"that the world was no longer experiencing an influenza pandemic,\" the organization said in a statement. CNN\"s Miriam Falco contributed to this report.\n","\n","(CNN) -- If there's a blessing in the current swine flu epidemic, it's how benign the illness seems to be outside the central disease cluster in Mexico. But history offers a dark warning to anyone ready to write off the 2009 H1N1 virus. The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 sickened an estimated third of the world's population. In each of the four major pandemics since 1889, a spring wave of relatively mild illness was followed by a second wave, a few months later, of a much more virulent disease. This was true in 1889, 1957, 1968 and in the catastrophic flu outbreak of 1918, which sickened an estimated third of the world's population and killed, conservatively, 50 million people. Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist at George Washington University, who has studied the course of prior pandemics in both the United States and her native Denmark, says, \"The good news from past pandemics, in several experiences, is that the majority of deaths have happened not in the first wave, but later.\" Based on this, Simonsen suggests there may be time to develop an effective vaccine before a second, more virulent strain, begins to circulate. As swine flu -- also known as the 2009 version of the H1N1 flu strain -- spreads, Simonsen and other health experts are diving into the history books for clues about how the outbreak might unfold -- and, more importantly, how it might be contained. In fact, the official Pandemic Influenza Operation Plan, or O-Plan, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is based in large part on a history lesson -- research organized by pediatrician and medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan. Markel was tapped by the CDC to study what worked and what didn't during the 1918 flu disaster. Markel and colleagues examined 43 cities and found that so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions -- steps such as isolating patients and school closings -- were remarkably successful in tamping down the outbreak. \"They don't make the population immune, but they buy you time, either by preventing influenza from getting into the community or slowing down the spread,\" Markel said.  Explainer: Flu facts » . Markel describes a dramatic example in the mining town of Gunnison, Colorado. In 1918, town leaders built a veritable barricade, closing down the railroad station and blocking all roads into town. Four thousand townspeople lived on stockpiled supplies and food from hunting or fishing. For 3½ months, while influenza raged in nearly every city in America, Gunnison saw not a single case of flu -- not until the spring, when roads were reopened and a handful of residents fell sick.  Visit LIFE.com for photographs of the lethal flu pandemic of 1918 . Nonpharmaceutical interventions, or NPIs, also proved effective in big cities such as New York, according to Markel. In fact, the sooner cities moved to limit public gatherings or isolate patients, the less severe their experience tended to be -- as much as an eight- or ninefold difference in case and death rates, he says. Based on this guidance, the CDC preparedness plan devotes dozens of pages to potential NPIs, from voluntary isolation to reorganizing company work schedules to reduce the density of people sitting next to each other in the office or while riding trains and buses. If it seems odd to base medical strategy on 90-year-old newspapers, the approach is increasingly popular. \"There's a big case for looking at history,\" says Simonsen. \"We call it archaeo-epidemiology. You go to libraries and places like that, dig around, collaborate with people like John Barry and try to quantify what really worked.\"  Map: where the flu is today » . Barry is the author of \"The Great Influenza,\" perhaps the signature history of the devastating 1918 pandemic. He says the historical record shows that isolating patients worked to slow the spread of flu in 1918, but that attempted quarantines -- preventing movement in and out of cities -- was \"worthless.\" While Barry supports the CDC's general containment strategy, in the past he has publicly criticized Markel's work. After Markel's findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Barry wrote a letter in response, saying it wasn't swift action but rather an earlier wave of mild flu, acting like a vaccination, that was probably responsible for New York's relatively low caseload. In the letter, he noted, \"New York City Health Commissioner Royal Copeland did tell reporters ... that he would isolate and quarantine cases,\" but based on his own articles in the New York Medical Journal, he \"apparently never imposed those measures.\" In response, Markel and CDC officials pointed to a decision by the New York Board of Health making influenza a reportable disease, and a 1918 JAMA article describing strict quarantine efforts in New York. Barry says both those sources rely on Copeland's assertions, which he considers unreliable. It looks superficially like an academic feud, but in this field, different conclusions can suggest radically different approaches to quashing a pandemic. Nowhere is this more true than in research that builds computer models to predict the spread of outbreaks, based on previous ones. Markel, along with most analysts, says that in prior pandemics, the so-called R-naught number -- the number of new infections caused by each infected person -- has been approximately 2.0. The current U.S. pandemic control strategy is based on computer simulations that assume a flu virus with an R-naught between 1.6 and 2.4. Last year, however, Simonsen and Viggo Andreasen concluded that the true R-naught of the 1918 flu virus was probably somewhere between 3 and 4. Since an epidemic grows exponentially -- each person sickens three others, each of whom infects three more, and so on -- this is a tremendous difference. \"It says it's going to be harder than we thought\" to control a pandemic, Simonsen says. Barry agrees. \"I do think that some of these things, like isolating [sick people], will take off some of the edge. We hope they'll do more than that. But to think they'll stop a pandemic, that is just not going to happen.\" Simonsen says control measures such as the steps taken by Mexico in recent days -- closing schools and restaurants, for example -- are still worth the effort. \"It doesn't mean we should give up, because we don't know the R-naught [for swine flu]. We don't know how easily this spreads.\" But she adds, NPIs are at best a way to buy time. \"We just badly need a vaccine. That's the most important thing.\" To date, the CDC has emphasized personal protective steps such as washing hands and using hand gels, as opposed to tightening border controls or issuing formal directives to close schools or limit public gatherings. Such steps have been left to state and local officials, who have responded in a variety of ways. One reason for the delay in stronger guidelines is that swine flu caught planners off guard; they had anticipated being able to recognize a pandemic overseas, weeks or at least days before it hit the United States. At the same time, CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser said Thursday that it's important to let officials tailor their response to local conditions. \"They can take the recommendations we're providing and apply them locally. [By doing that] we hope to learn and see what are the most effective control strategies.\" Markel agrees that the best response depends on the particular situation. \"History is not predictive science. And the powers of public health officials [in 1918] were much greater. Another difference is that people's trust of doctors and government in 1918 was probably remarkably different.... But what I have found, studying epidemics, is that good planning and good relationships between local state and federal authorities, goes a long way.\"\n","\n","(CNN) -- If there's a blessing in the current swine flu epidemic, it's how benign the illness seems to be outside the central disease cluster in Mexico.

The outbreak is only about 10 days old, and even if the illness is declining, it could return, said Gregory Hartl, the WHO spokesman for epidemic and pandemic diseases, at a briefing Sunday. \"I ... would like to remind people that in 1918 the Spanish flu showed a surge in the spring, and then disappeared in the summer months, only to return in the autumn of 1918 with a vengeance,\" Hartl said. \"And we know that that eventually killed 40 million to 50 million people.\" Mexican authorities believe the virus's most active period in Mexico was between April 23 and April 28, and Mexican Health Secretary Jose Cordova described the outbreak as being in decline in his country. As of late Sunday, Mexican health officials reported 568 cases and 22 fatalities linked to the flu. WHO says it has confirmed 506 cases and 19 deaths in Mexico. The world has 898 confirmed cases of the virus, known to scientists H1N1 virus, in a total of 18 countries, WHO said Sunday. The United States has reported 226 confirmed cases in 30 states. The U.S. cases include one death -- a Mexican toddler visiting relatives in the United States. According to WHO, Canada has 70 confirmed cases; the United Kingdom has 15; Spain has 13; Germany has 6; New Zealand has 4; Israel has 3; France has 2; and Austria, China, South Korea, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Costa Rica and Ireland each have one. In China, officials have quarantined 68 people, including 13 crew members, who were passengers of a Mexico City to Shanghai flight, which carried a passenger who tested positive for the virus, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. None of the other passengers has exhibited any flu-like symptoms, one health official said. About another 110 people who were on the Aeromexico plane went on to other destinations, and may face quarantines elsewhere, the news agency said. Fifteen have been quarantined at a Beijing hotel. Shanghai's airport is now barring other Aeromexico planes from landing there, a representative of the airline told CNN. Aeromexico is suspending flights to Shanghai until May 15, the representative said. The airline does not fly to Hong Kong or Beijing. In the United States, New York has the most confirmed cases, with 63, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Texas has 40; California has 26; Arizona 18; South Carolina 15; Delaware 10; Massachusetts and New Jersey each have seven; Colorado has four; Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin each have three; Connecticut, Kansas and Michigan each have two; Alabama, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Utah each have one. California officials suspended visitation and other \"nonessential activities\" at Centinela State Prison in Imperial County after an inmate was suspected of having swine flu. The case has yet to be confirmed with lab testing. On Sunday, health officials in North Carolina and Pennsylvania announced the first confirmed cases in those states, and Louisiana's governor said his state had seven confirmed cases. The cases from those three states were not immediately included in the CDC tally. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius, appearing on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" warned that even if the flu outbreak wanes, \"it could come back with greater force in the winter and fall, when we get into flu season.\" \"So, this is no time for complacency,\" she said. \"We want to stay out ahead of this.\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's interim deputy director for public health, told reporters Sunday that she was \"heartened\" by Mexican authorities' reports but still is \"very cautious.\" \"I know that influenza can be surprising, and the time course here in the United States is later. We believe we're just on the upswing here, and in several parts of Mexico, cases began quite a while ago,\" Schuchat said. \"From what I know about influenza, I do expect more cases, more severe cases and I do expect more deaths,\" she added. \"And I'm particularly concerned about what will happen in the fall.\" Acting CDC Director Richard Besser, also speaking on \"State of the Union,\" said U.S. health officials are examining whether people who received flu shots for the swine flu in 1976 may have some level of protection from the current swine flu. \"That's going to play in very, very big as we move forward with our plans around vaccines, because that may help guide some of the issues around who is most at risk at getting this in the future,\" Besser said. Offering a general picture of the state of U.S. efforts to combat the virus, Besser said \"there are encouraging signs.\" \"We're not out of the woods yet,\" he said. \"But what we've learned about the virus itself -- it doesn't contain the factors that we know are seen in much more severe flu strains.\" While the new virus strain in the recent outbreak has affected humans, Canadian officials said it has shown up at a pig farm in Alberta, Canada. Officials said the pigs may have been infected by a Canadian farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak. The pigs have since been quarantined. \"We have determined that the virus H1N1, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population,\" said Dr. Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. iReport.com: How should H1N1 be handled?

The archive includes Newton's college notebooks and some of his most important writings from the 1660s on mathematics and calculus, optics and gravity. They appear alongside an annotated copy of \"Principia Mathematica,\" the book in which Newton set out his laws of motion and gravity, and which is regarded as one of the world's most significant scientific works. More than 4,000 pages of Newton material have been digitized so far, with archivists photographing and uploading as many as 200 pages a day. Grant Young, the library's digitization manager, said the collection contained \"perhaps some of the most important papers and documents in the history of science,\" which would give viewers a valuable insight into Newton's working methods. \"Anyone, wherever they are, can see at the click of a mouse how Newton worked and how he went about developing his theories and experiments,\" he said. \"Before today, anyone who wanted to see these things had to come to Cambridge. Now we're bringing Cambridge University Library to the world.\" Many of the papers -- some of them badly damaged by fire or water -- have undergone delicate conservation work before being added to the archive. They are also accompanied by transcriptions by the University of Sussex's Newton Project, allowing readers to decipher Newton's handwriting. But some of the notes added to the papers over the years suggest some of the scientist's contemporaries may not have approved of the online publication. Several of the manuscripts contain the line \"not fit to be printed,\" written by Thomas Pellet, who was asked to review Newton's work after his death. The Newton archive is part of Cambridge's Digital Library project that will eventually showcase other important scientific papers, including the works of Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin and Ernest Rutherford. Part of Darwin's personal library of hundreds of books -- many of them packed with the scientist's notes in the margins -- is already online.

Lift to space: This is a NASA interpretation of what a space elevator may look like. The project is a \"space elevator,\" and some experts now believe that the concept is well within the bounds of possibility -- maybe even within our lifetimes. A conference discussing developments in space elevator concepts is being held in Japan in November, and hundreds of engineers and scientists from Asia, Europe and the Americas are working to design the only lift that will take you directly to the one hundred-thousandth floor. Despite these developments, you could be excused for thinking it all sounds a little far-fetched. Indeed, if successfully built, the space elevator would be an unprecedented feat of human engineering. A cable anchored to the Earth's surface, reaching tens of thousands of kilometers into space, balanced with a counterweight attached at the other end is the basic design for the elevator. It is thought that inertia -- the physics theory stating that matter retains its velocity along a straight line so long as it is not acted upon by an external force -- will cause the cable to stay stretched taut, allowing the elevator to sit in geostationary orbit. The cable would extend into the sky, eventually reaching a satellite docking station orbiting in space. Engineers hope the elevator will transport people and objects into space, and there have even been suggestions that it could be used to dispose of nuclear waste. Another proposed idea is to use the elevator to place solar panels in space to provide power for homes on Earth. If it sounds like the stuff of fiction, maybe that's because it once was. In 1979, Arthur C. Clarke's novel \"The Fountains of Paradise\" brought the idea of a space elevator to a mass audience. Charles Sheffield's \"The Web Between the Worlds\" also featured the building of a space elevator. But, jump out of the storybooks and fast-forward nearly three decades, and Japanese scientists at the Japan Space Elevator Association are working seriously on the space-elevator project. Association spokesman Akira Tsuchida said his organization was working with U.S.-based Spaceward Foundation and a European organization based in Luxembourg to develop an elevator design. The Liftport Group in the U.S. is also working on developing a design, and in  total it's believed that more than 300 scientists and engineers are engaged in such work around the globe. NASA is holding a $4 million Space Elevator Challenge to encourage designs for a successful space elevator. Tsuchida said the technology driving the race to build the first space elevator is the quickly developing material carbon nanotube. It is lightweight and has a tensile strength 180 times stronger than that of a steel cable. Currently, it is the only material with the potential to be strong enough to use to manufacture elevator cable, according to Tsuchida. \"At present we have a tether which is made of carbon nanotube, and has one-third or one-quarter of the strength required to make a space elevator. We expect that we will have strong enough cable in the 2020s or 2030s,\" Tsuchida said. He said the most likely method of powering the elevator would be through the carbon nanotube cable. So, what are the major logistical issues keeping the space elevator from being anything more than a dream at present? Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics and astronautics Professor Jeff Hoffman said that designing the carbon nanotube appeared to be the biggest obstacle. \"We are now on the verge of having material that has the strength to span the 30,000 km ... but we don't have the ability to make long cable out of the carbon nanotubes at the moment.\" he said. \"Although I'm confident that within a reasonable amount of time we will be able to do this.\" Tsuchida said that one of the biggest challenges will be acquiring funding to move the projects forward. At present, there is no financial backing for the space elevator project, and all of the Japanese group's 100-plus members maintain other jobs to earn a living. \"Because we don't have a material which has enough strength to construct space elevator yet, it is difficult to change people's mind so they believe that it can be real,\" he said. Hoffman feels that international dialogue needs to be encouaraged on the issue. He said a number of legal considerations also would have to be taken into account. \"This is not something one nation or one company can do. There needs to be a worldwide approach,\" he said. Other difficulties for space-elevator projects include how to build the base for the elevator, how to design it and where to set up the operation. Tsuchida said some possible locations for an elevator include the South China Sea, western Australia and the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. He said all of those locations usually avoided typhoons, which could pose a threat to the safety of an elevator. \"As the base of space elevator will be located on geosynchronous orbit, [the] space elevator ground station should be located near the equator,\" he said. Although the Japanese association has set a time frame of the 2030s to get a space elevator under construction -- and developments are moving quickly -- Hoffman acknowledges that it could be a little further away than that. \"I don't know if it's going to be in our lifetime or if it's 100 or 200 years away, but it's near enough that we can contemplate how it will work.\" Building a space elevator is a matter of when, not if, said Hoffman, who believes that it will herald a major new period in human history. \"It will be revolutionary for human technology, and not just for space travel. That's why so many people are pursuing it,\" he said. \"This is what it will take to turn humans into a space-bearing species.\"\n","\n","Question: What is Newton's law on inertia?\n","Helpful Answer: The law of inertia states that a body at rest tends to remain at rest and a body in motion tends to remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force.\n","\n","क्या javaab sahi hai?\n","---\n","Yes, the answer is correct. nyootan ka jadatva ka niyam yah hai ki ek vastu jo sthir hai, uske sthir rahne ki sambhaavna adhik hoti hai, aur ek vastu jo gati mein hoti hai, uske gati mein bani rahne ki sambhaavna adhik hoti hai, jab tak ki baahri bal se hastakshep na ho.

How can you protect yourself? And should RF emission information be listed on cell phone packaging, and in stores? First things first: The WHO study did not say \"cell phones cause brain cancer.\" Rather, there is some evidence indicating a possible connection -- and while not conclusive, it warrants further study. Consequently, WHO has now categorized radio frequency electromagnetic fields as a \"group 2B\" possible human carcinogen. Here's how Ed Yong, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, explained it in his detailed analysis of the WHO announcement: . \"Group 2B means that there is some evidence for a risk but it's not that convincing. This group ends up being a bit of a catch-all category, and includes everything from carpentry to chloroform.\" Dr. Gupta: Cell phones, brain tumors . So it's worth being aware of this classification -- just as you should be mindful of your intake of coffee, another group 2B carcinogen. But this announcement is not a reason to panic. Would labels help? San Francisco has been wrestling with whether to require cell phones to be labeled for their RF emissions. Last year, the city tried to mandate cell phone radiation labeling in stores, originally to take effect February 2011. But according to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"implementation was delayed until May 1, then June 15. There now is no proposed start date.\" The city backtracked on this partly out of concern over a lawsuit filed by the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association -- but also because officials didn't know how to ensure the accuracy of the labels. Scientists aren't sure what's the most realistic, intuitive way to communicate cell phone RF emissions to consumers. Specific absorption rate, a measure of the rate of RF energy that your body absorbs from the phone, is the most commonly cited benchmark. For a phone to be certified by the FCC and sold in the U.S., for example, its maximum SAR level must be less than 1.6 watts per kilogram. But Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at University of California, Berkeley, told the Chronicle that \"specific absorption rate isn't a very useful measure because it's the peak reading on a variety of tests conducted on cell phones to measure their radiation, but doesn't indicate the average amount of radiation a user would generally be exposed to.\" He likened it to a car's gas mileage being reported only based on driving it up a steep hill. Such a measurement could actually make a car shopper avoid a hybrid because it doesn't perform well on hills, even though it would generally consume less gas. CNET recently updated its guide to cell phone radiation levels, which ranks phones according to SAR. Cell phones and radiation: The 10 highest- and lowest-emitting models . What cell phone users can do . If you are concerned that cell phones might increase your cancer risk, probably the best way to put the WHO announcement to good use is to minimize how much you hold your cell phone next to your head. More tips on minimizing cell phone radiation . Your best bet is to use a headset that physically plugs in to your phone, such as earbuds with a microphone attached. Unlike Bluetooth headsets, this entails no additional RF exposure near your head -- although it may take a moment to connect your headset to your phone. While the WHO examined only the possible risk of brain cancer, you can further reduce your cell phone RF exposure by placing your phone a few inches away from your body while using it -- such as in a purse or on the table. Or whenever possible, talk via your phone's speaker function, or send a text message instead of placing a call.

Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that high levels of radioactive substances were found in seawater near the plant, but said that the results did not represent a threat to human health. \"There should be no immediate health impact. If this situation continues for a long period of time, some impact can occur,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. The impact such radiation could have on marine life was unclear. Japanese authorities were scheduled to measure radioactivity in waters around the plant on Tuesday and Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Earlier seawater radiation monitoring detected levels of iodine-131 that were 126.7 times higher than government-set standards, the electric company said on its website. Its monitors detected cesium-134, which has a half-life of about two years, about 24.8 times higher than the government standards. Cesium-137 was found to be 16.5 times higher than the standard. The electric company detected these levels in seawater 100 meters (328 feet) south of the nuclear power plant Monday afternoon. Radioactive particles disperse in the ocean, and the farther away from the shore a sample is taken, the less concentrated the contamination should be. Because of the huge amount of dilution that happens in the ocean, there's not much chance of deep-water fish being tainted, said Murray McBride, a professor at Cornell University who studies soil and water contamination. \"I think the ocean can handle that a lot better than the physical environment and population centers,\" said Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a CNN consultant. \"We don't want any of this to happen, but better it go out to sea than stay in Japan.\" Winds have largely blown radioactive material emitted by the plant offshore since an earthquake and tsunami crippled cooling systems at the plant March 11. But tests have detected contamination of food grown near the plant. The Japanese government has banned the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture, where the plant is located, and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards, the country's health ministry reported. And officials in Fukushima halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture. The government has also banned sales of spinach and milk from parts of Gunma and Tochigi Prefectures, according to the prime minister's office. On Tuesday Edano said contamination had not been detected in other agricultural products. \"The products which are being grown in these areas are being monitored and the monitoring will continue,\" he said. He urged consumers to \"try not to panic,\" noting that the government had stopped shipments of any farm products they believed could be contaminated. Edano has stressed that officials believe the levels of radiation in food -- while above the legal standards -- do not pose any immediate health risk, saying they were mostly dangerous only if consumed repeatedly over one's lifetime. On Monday a spokesman for the World Health Organization said short-term exposure to food contaminated by radiation from Japan's damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant poses no immediate health risk. Tests have also detected radiation in tap water. On Monday, authorities in the village of Iitake urged residents to avoid drinking tap water that tests showed contained more than three times the maximum standard of radioactive iodine. Water in other jurisdictions showed lesser signs of contamination, although far below levels of concern under Japanese law, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency website. The U.N. agency said it had received reports from Japan's government that six out of 46 samples tested positive for the iodine-131 radioactive isotope. Iodine and cesium isotopes are byproducts of nuclear fission in reactors such as the ones damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Honshu, Japan's main island. Although iodine-131 has a radioactive half-life of eight days, cesium-137's half-life is about 30 years. The decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake, tsunami and other potential fallout from the Fukushima plant. Edano has said farmers will be compensated for revenue lost by the restrictions. \"Primarily this is due to the nuclear reactor accident, so we assume (Tokyo Electric Power Company) will be held responsible for compensation. The government might take some supplementary action,\" he said. Fukushima ranks among Japan's top producer of fruits, vegetables and rice. Ibaraki, south of Fukushima, supplies Tokyo with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is Japan's third-largest pork producer. For radiation to be an issue for rice, the contamination would have to be more severe and prolonged that what has been seen so far, said McBride, the Cornell University professor. Soil contamination was a huge issue around Chernobyl, but the radiation emitted from the Fukushima Daiichi plant isn't anywhere near that level, he said. \"We're not at that stage; that's the scenario you have to consider if contamination gets severe enough,\" McBride said. CNN's Jo Kent, Steven Jiang, Martin Savidge, Paul Ferguson, Thom Patterson, Matt Smith and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.\n","\n","(CNN) -- Tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the USS Ronald Reagan after conducting disaster relief missions in Japan, the military said Monday. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. In addition, the Navy said the U.S. 7th Fleet has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after detecting low-level contamination in the air and on its planes in the area, the Navy said. One ship was operating about 100 miles northeast of the power plant when \"airborne radioactivity\" was detected, the Navy said. The Navy's statement, however, provided some perspective, noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by personnel when the ship passed through the area was \"less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks, soil, and the sun.\" On Sunday, the USS Ronald Reagan started delivering aid in the coastal regions of Japan's Miyagi prefecture. Crew members, in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces, conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets. Eight U.S. and Japanese helicopters were used to distribute the pallets, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley of U.S. Forces Japan. Workers are scrambling to cool down fuel rods and prevent a full meltdown in three reactors at the earthquake-hit plant. Radioactive steam has been released, intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the reactors.\n","\n","ogTMJZL5XZAJD8TXa/sV/wZ8CoJFqSMFmh0vUknkTRP7TrlROt24GcmKogyjHIYu51cQ0bokPShbakgKeiomCUb43OrJLgnlX3C4Jn6e6MgqdajNLaTKTEDvexNxf+8dm56tahgIssNCDo/1Ms5NhJPa8IJUzY7H1lCqGL2r5gOiCLUdqBdW0KwHHmVhNXKVSW4rZbrtUUbJXSKztAFCtAlqqMb1EAhougJvaA39O48O6/Oh/M5H11zFjsn6A+cyTfnKaEK</latexit>activity\n","\n","Question: Describe radioactivity\n","Helpful Answer:\n","\n","A: Radiation is emitted by radioactive material\n","B: विकिरण का उत्सर्जन करने वाली सामग्री\n","C: Radioactive material\n","D: विकिरण\n","\n","Answer: B\n","\n","A: Radiation is emitted by radioactive material\n","B: विकिरण का उत्सर्जन करने वाली सामग्री\n","C: Radioactive material\n","D: विकिरण\n","---\n","Radiation is emitted by radioactive material.\n","\n","व्याख्याः\n","1.

Danish Kaneria, in action against India last December, was hoping to play in the Indian Premier League. Stars from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies and, for the first time, England will be competing in the action that starts on April 10. Several Pakistan stars had also signed for IPL franchises while another five, including leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, were scheduled to appear at a players' auction to be held in Goa, India, on Thursday. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said players would not be allowed to play in the IPL this coming season on government advice. \"We have informed the IPL and Indian board that our players can't take part in the IPL this year,\" PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf told Reuters.com. The decision follows concerns for players' safety because of the tense relations between Pakistan and India after the Mumbai militant attacks in November. Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, who plays for Delhi, said the players would abide by the directives of the government and PCB. Meanwhile, another former captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq is among several top Pakistan players who have successfully challenged a domestic ban imposed following appearances in the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). Provincial Sindh High Court on Monday suspended the 2007 action taken by the PCB which must appear in court later this month to explain their action. Players affected by the 2007 ruling also include Mohammad Yousuf, Imran Nazir, Mohammad Sami and Azhar Mahmood who along with Inzamam, played for Lahore Badshahs. Last year, the Badshahs named after a Pakistani city and with a number of Pakistani players won the ICL 20s Indian championship. \"The honorable court has suspended this relevant clause of the PCB rules and allowed the players to appear in domestic cricket with immediate effect,\" Zahid Fakhruddin Ibrahim, the legal counsel for the players, told Reuters.com. Lahore coach Moin Khan, a former Pakistan captain, said the suspension of the ban was good for Pakistani cricket. \"Some of the ICL players can still play for Pakistan and when they play in domestic cricket, youngsters will learn from them,\" Khan commented. \"The ban had hurt the players financially as well as cricket-wise, so it's a great decision.\"\n","\n","NEW DELHI (CNN) -- India's Tata Motors Monday announced it would begin delivery of the Nano, billed as the world's \"cheapest car\", in July.

Revealing the news on their official website, the Primera Liga champions could be in line to receive up to 170 million euros ($225m) for the five-and-a-half year deal, which incorporates commercial and image rights as well as various bonuses relating to success on the field. Children's charity UNICEF has appeared on the club's shirts in recent seasons and their logo will continue to feature prominently. However, kit manufacturer Nike will now redesign the jerseys to accomodate the name of the Qatar Foundation -- an organization set up in 1995 to improve education and community development in Qatar and the surrounding region. Following the news, UNICEF released a statement, saying: \"The groundbreaking partnership between UNICEF and FC Barcelona advanced the global message on the importance of children's issues in a unique way. \"UNICEF is looking forward to the next stage of the collaboration and is exploring various options.\" Barcelona also released a breakdown of how the funds will be received, with the club getting 15m euros ($20m) for the second half of the season and 30m euros ($40m) for each of the following five seasons -- with up to 5m euros ($7m) in bonuses for any titles won. The funds will provide a welcome boost for Barcelona, who have struggled financially, despite all their successes on the pitch. The Catalan club made a loss of 80m euros ($105m) last season and are reported to have debts in the region of  440m euros. The announcement also continues Qatar's increasing influence in world football following their recent winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup finals.\n","\n","Question: Can you confirm if TATA is the IPL Sponsor?\n","Helpful Answer:\n","---\n","हां, टाटा आईपीएल का प्रायोजक है, जो इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग नामक एक क्रिकेट टूर्नामेंट है। It is one of the most popular and lucrative cricket leagues in the world. टाटा मोटर्स, जो टाटा नामक एक भारतीय बहुराष्ट्रीय समूह है, ने 2007 में खिलाड़ियों पर लगाए गए प्रतिबंध को सफलतापूर्वक चुनौती देकर आई. पी. एल. में खेलने के लिए कई पाकिस्तानी खिलाड़ियों को मंजूरी दी है।\n"]}],"source":["# generating the response with LLM and the knowledge from our explicitly provided data [llama-2-arxiv paper dataset]\n","response_with_rag = rag_pipeline(query)\n","\n","# print(response_with_rag)\n","for key, value in response_with_rag.items():\n","  print(f'{key}: {value}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"bBhz27yJgFPR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712577928961,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":39,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"04491539720881734151"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##4"],"metadata":{"id":"_AIW3JUurGN9"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712578046530,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":51885,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"04491539720881734151"}},"outputId":"fbb5121b-b2c2-4ef6-a5a1-d08b45277609","id":"NvvI1vrWrGOM"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["क्या आप पुष्टि कर सकते हैं कि टाटा आईपीएल के स्पॉन्सर हैं?\n"," hopefully so!\n","\n","11. ऑनलाइन खोज करें।\n","The best way to confirm Tata is a sponsor is to do an online search. आप टाटा के प्रायोजकों की सूची के बारे में जानकारी प्राप्त करने के लिए उनकी वेबसाइट पर जा सकते हैं या आप टाटा के प्रायोजकों के बारे में जानकारी के लिए आधिकारिक टाटा सोशल मीडिया पेजों की खोज कर सकते हैं।\n","\n","For example, you can search \"Tata sponsors\" or \"Tata sponsors cricket\" to find out if they are sponsors of Tata IPL.\n","आप आधिकारिक टाटा सोशल मीडिया पेजों को भी खोज सकते हैं।\n","\n","12.

Indian brides and grooms from the Adivasi tribe take part in a mass marriage ceremony. Love may be recession proof in India, but arranged marriages are not. One of the casualties of the global economic slowdown is the Non Resident Indian (NRI) groom. They were once considered premium marriage material. After all, these were the men who had typically studied hard, gotten top jobs in the West, earned big bucks and could whisk their wives away to better opportunities in the West. Not anymore. \"Yeah, I hate to say it but the NRI man seems to be out of favor with the Indian woman,\" said Gaurav Rakshit of Shaadi.com, a matrimonial search engine used by 14 million people globally. He has seen demand for NRI grooms drop by around 20 to 30 percent since the recession hit. Why? Shweta Gupta, a 23-year-old student, has an answer. \"Many Indians working abroad have come back due to recession hitting foreign countries and I don't think recession has affected India that much,\" said said. She believes there is greater job security in India, so would prefer her husband to be based here. Her mother, who is involved in finding a suitable man for her daughter, agreed. \"Suppose there is no job security, then again he would have to come to India, then again he would have to find a job for himself, so I would prefer both of them to be here. Plus, I want my daughter to be close to me,\" said Shraddha Gupta. Arranged marriages are still the norm in India and parents play an active role in choosing a life partner for their children. Traditionally, parents will let friends know that they are on the lookout for a partner for their child. Sometimes, they go to a marriage broker -- a middleman who keeps a stash of resumes and photos of eligible men and women whose families have registered with them. As Indians get more tech savvy, more people are taking their search for partners online. Matrimonial Web sites are popular since they offer a much bigger pool of potential life partners. Shweta Gupta is currently pursuing an MBA in Mumbai and is confident of getting good job offers in India --- another reason she would not want to risk that by going abroad. \"As the woman finds her voice in Indian society, a part of the trend is defined by her unwillingness to compromise on where she grew up, the kind of person she wants to be with, the value system she wants to associate with,\" Rakshit said. Women in India are comfortable with the opportunities they have at home and don't feel they need to go abroad to have a better life. As a result, NRI men are out. So, who is in? Well, government employees, who are typically thought to hold more stable jobs. Shaadi.com said demand was up around 45 percent since last year for men with these jobs.

But you don't need Thai lessons to pronounce her name, because she goes by the nickname \"Newey\". Most Thais forsake their formal names for a single nickname. At 30, Newey is a Thai citizen and director of the Youth Venture program in Thailand, an initiative that is empowering young \"changemakers,\" as the parent organization Ashoka calls them, to improve the quality of life in their communities. Ashoka is a global, not-for-profit organization working to promote social change. What they do and how they do it will be the subject of Newey's blogs, because it is very different from anything you've ever seen. We'll link you to Ashoka's Web site as well. Newey has quite a track record of working in this field, having co-founded YIY, a youth group that creates opportunities for young people to grow into engaged citizens and social entrepreneurs. Her day-to-day role as Youth Venture director takes her to all parts of Thailand to meet, encourage and support 14-24 year-olds -- be they middle class, underprivileged, marginalized, or delinquent.

A banana vendor stands on a flooded street as he waits for customers in Amritsar, India, on August 13. After three spectacular years of 9 percent-plus annual growth, India will reach just 6.3 percent next year, according to the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund in early November. The Reserve Bank of India is forecasting a more optimistic 7.5 to 8 percent. While 7.5 percent may still sound a good result, it is barely enough for the economy to keep pace with the 10 million-plus young people who will join the Indian job market in 2009. India's major shortcomings in infrastructure, education, health care and environmental protection are well known, as are the constant problems of corruption, poor governance, rural poverty, communalism, domestic terrorism, child labor, discrimination against women and natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. But at least in recent years India could point to a strong economy as the platform on which it was making its push for higher living standards, social modernization and economic reform. Since May 2004, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram took on the reins of government, India's economy has had a charmed run. Strong growth in business sectors such asinformation technology, pharmaceuticals, automotive, financial services and retail have coincided with a better performing agricultural sector, and a housing and consumption boom driven by easier credit. India's young working men and women -- more than half the country's 1.15 billion people are aged 25 or less -- have shown a much greater propensity to spend, compared to their thrifty, risk-averse parents and grandparents. This willingness to go into debt rather than save has seen a massive rise in sales of consumer goods such as mobile phones, flat screen TVs, refrigerators, household utensils, motorcycles and cars. The same goes for spending on services, from tourism to healthcare to self-improvement. Now the halcyon days appear to be over, as the international credit crunch flattens demand everywhere. Already the downturn is seeing job losses in sectors such as aviation, financial services, retailing and export industries, as companies tighten their belts and put expansion plans on hold. The government admits things will get tougher, with Singh telling the nation on October 20 that \"we must be prepared for a temporary slowdown in the Indian economy.\" Earlier that day, the Reserve Bank of India cut its key repurchase (short-term lending) rate by 100 basis points to 8 percent, saying it needed to ease the pressure on India's credit markets and maintain financial stability. It followed that with another cut to 7.5 percent on November 1. RBI Governor Dr. D. Subbarao noted the global downturn could be deeper and the recovery might take longer than earlier expected. \"Consequently, the adverse implications through trade and financial channels for emerging economies, including India, have amplified,\" he said. Economists and analysts have welcomed the central bank's moves, which have included a 350-basis point reduction in the cash reserve ratio -- the amount of money Indian banks must keep on hand -- between July and November. Tushar Poddar, head of Asian economic research at investment bank Goldman Sachs, said the RBI's October 20 action was \"well ahead of market expectations\" and showed a bias towards growth and financial stability, against inflation. Goldman Sachs had earlier cut its growth outlook for the 2009-10FY to 7 percent and has warned the figure could go lower if the international financial turmoil continues over the next few months. But Poddar believes that India's export drive -- which has seen exports triple since 2003 to about $163 billion in 2007-08FY -- may not suffer too greatly. In a recent study, he found that about two-thirds of India's exports go outside the United States and the European Union (the two trade areas most affected by the downturn) to China, Southeast Asia, West Asia and Africa. While Indian exports would slow, \"the downside is limited,\" he said. A lower Indian rupee would also help. Foreign investment is slowing in line with the downturn. Morgan Stanley's India economist Chetan Ahya noted recently that \"adverse global circumstances\" are weighing on India's ability to attract overseas money. Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the global credit markets, Ahya believes capital inflows could slow to $40-50 billion in the year ahead, compared with $110 billion in 2008. On the broader political front, India has to deal with a range of internal and external risks that include domestic communalism-cum-terrorism and the constant threat of conflict with Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir territory. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka all add to a difficult neighborhood, while India's relations with China are cool at best, even as trade ties grow. Territorial disputes linger from the 1962 border war between the two. That helps explain why India was named recently by Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) as the Asia-Pacific country with the highest political and social risk for 2009. A report by PERC in late October assessed 16 countries in the Asia Pacific region, and assigned India the highest risk rating of 6.87, ahead of Thailand with 6.28. China was seventh with 5.33, behind Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia. PERC cited uncertainties surrounding India's coming general election -- due to be held by May 2009 -- along with rising communal violence and incidents of terrorism. \"The biggest risk is that a deterioration in political and economic conditions in neighboring Pakistan could aggravate social unrest in India further, and hurt national security,\" it noted. But it said India's underlying attractions to foreign investors should remain, \"no matter who wins the next election. Prime Minister Singh, with six months of his government to run, is putting on a brave face. \"It is when India is challenged that the Indian people rise to the occasion and convert the challenge into an opportunity. There is no place for fear,\" he told the nation late last month.

Kapil Sibal, the country's human resources development minister, displayed what he called a low-cost computing and access device in New Delhi on Thursday. The ministry said the price would gradually fall to $10 apiece. India said connectivity to all its colleges and universities is key to achieving its education goals. Home to a billion-plus population, the country's literacy rate stands at 65 percent, according to the 2001 census figures. Nevertheless, the South Asian nation has made giant strides in various areas since it opened up its economy in the early 1990s. The country ushered in a telecom revolution that delivered mobile telephony to nearly 600 million people in just a little more than a decade with highly competitive call tariffs. Now, India is preparing for another leap into the digital world. Recently, it auctioned off its airwaves for third-generation services to enable super-fast multimedia streaming of wireless. The move is aimed at bringing India's online market on a par with its booming cell-phone business through Internet penetration with technology allowing quick access, data transfer and entertainment on mobile handsets. The country has announced plans to link up all its 250,000 village councils by 2012 in a bid to plug massive broadband divides between rural and urban communities as it emerges as one of the world's few growth markets. Authorities say technical institutions involved in designing the new device are now setting up research to address price and quality issues in developing budget gadgets for students. \"The aim is to reach such devices to the students of colleges and universities, and to provide these institutions a host of choices of low-cost access devices around Rs 1,500 [$35] or less in near future,\" the human resources ministry said at the launch of the computer. Ministry spokeswoman Mamata Varma said the government aimed to introduce the new touch-screen computing tool at higher educational institutions in 2011. The ministry, she said, is expected to tender out contracts to private companies for mass production of its prototype. The Linux-based computer is equipped with an Internet browser, a PDF reader and several other facilities, she said.\n","\n","(CNN) -- Meet Phonchan Kraiwatnutsorn (Newey) and you quickly get the feeling, she is a no-nonsense young lady with a driving personality.

One trillion $1 bills stacked one on top of the other would reach nearly 68,000 miles into the sky. A billion is a thousand million, and a trillion is a thousand billion. To provide some perspective on just how big a trillion dollars is, think about it like this: A trillion dollars is the number 1 followed by 12 zeroes. Or you can think of it this way: One trillion $1 bills stacked one on top of the other would reach nearly 68,000 miles (about 109,400 kilometers) into the sky, or about a third of the way from the Earth to the moon. Some Republicans are hardly over the moon about the growing size of the proposed economic stimulus plan. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said this week that Americans have become desensitized to just how much money that is. \"To put a trillion dollars in context, if you spend a million dollars every day since Jesus was born, you still wouldn't have spent a trillion,\" McConnell said. CNN checked McConnell's numbers with noted Temple University math professor and author John Allen Paulos. \"A million dollars a day for 2,000 years is only three-quarters of a trillion dollars. It's a big number no matter how you slice it,\" Paulos said. Here's another way to look at it. \"A million seconds is about 11½ days. A billion seconds is about 32 years, and a trillion seconds is 32,000 years,\" Paulos said. \"People tend to lump them together, perhaps because they rhyme, but if you think of it in terms of a jail sentence, do you want to go to jail for 11½ days or 32 years or maybe 32,000 years? So, they're vastly different, and people generally don't really have a real visceral grasp of the differences among them.\" Everyone is tossing around the words million, billion and trillion. With the national debt now topping $10 trillion, following a $700 billion bank rescue and proposed $800 billion-plus stimulus package, have we become numb to the numbers?  How much is a trillion? » . \" 'Number' itself can be parsed 'number' or 'numb-er.' And maybe in this case, the latter is a better pronunciation,\" Paulos said. \"I think to some extent, we have ... evolved in a context where such big numbers were completely foreign.\" Perhaps a better way to get a \"grasp of the numbers,\" Paulos said, is to use them to describe the budgets of government programs. \"The [Environmental Protection Agency's], for example, annual budget is about $7.5 billion. So, a trillion dollars would fund the EPA in present dollars for 130 years -- more than a century. Or the National Science Foundation or National Cancer Institute have budgets of $5 [billion] or $6 billion. You could fund those for almost 200 years,\" he said. Times have certainly changed. Back in 1993, President Bill Clinton wanted a $30 billion jobs and investment package. He didn't get it. Just last year, President George W. Bush signed an emergency economic stimulus of $168 billion --- a tally that seems paltry compared with the amount requested today. The economic problem, many say, demands huge spending. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has called it \"the mother of all crises.\" The numbers are big, but so is the United States economy. The gross domestic product, which measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country, is about $14 trillion. Still, many wonder if we can afford it.   \"So we do have a big economy that may not be as vibrant as it was, but it is still a powerful economic engine. Knock on wood, we'll see what happens,\"  said Paulos.  Last week, the House passed an $819 billion emergency stimulus, and the Senate version is approaching $900 billion. In the end, whatever lawmakers hash out probably won't reach $1 trillion.

Tired with a headache and high fever, Gulenkina knew she was coming down with something. Yet she wasn't sure with what. Besides getting vaccinated, there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick. \"My symptoms were apparently the same as for regular flu: coughs, sneezes, high temperature, sore throat and headache.\" she says. But when her boyfriend took her to the doctor, her diagnosis was a little little bit of a shock. \"I had the swine flu!\" Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped counting the number of reported H1N1 virus incidents in this country, the American Medical Association says many of its members are starting to see more cases of the illness, along with early bouts of seasonal flu and colds. It's just that time of year when a lot of nasty bugs are out there. So the question is, what's the best way to protect yourself? Health experts will tell you the most effective way to fight the flu, including the H1N1 virus, is to get vaccinated, which causes your own body to make antibodies that target specific illnesses. After immunization, it takes up to 10 days for the vaccines to take effect. But there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick during the winter. Why boost your immune system? It's what protects you from diseases. It's designed to defend the body against millions of toxins, parasites, bacteria and microbes that would love to invade the body and make it their home. But in order to protect you, your immune system has to be healthy. If it begins to break down, then germs can attack and cause you to become ill. That's why taking care of your immune system, especially this time of year, is a must. And the best way to start is with good nutrition. You need to eat the right foods. \"Your nutrition profoundly affects your ability to fight these diseases,\" notes Katherine Tallmadge, national spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. That means fill up your plate with lean protein, including chicken, fish and fat-free dairy products. Why protein? \"The molecules that fight disease are made of protein,\" Tallmadge says. Watch more on how to rev up your immune system » . And think fats. Good fats. Certain fats improve cellular function and the ability to fight disease. For instance, when people eat more liquid oils, as opposed to hard, saturated fats, the fats end up in their cell walls. With liquid oils predominantly in the diet, cells are more flexible, communicate better and are more able to fight disease . \"More olive oil, canola oil and nuts. These are healthy fats,\" says Tallmadge. Tallmadge also reminds us to include fruits, vegetables and whole grains in our diet. These contain important antioxidants that keep your blood levels of vitamin C, beta-carotene, zinc and B-vitamins high. Which also means think vitamin supplements. But not too many. Nutritionists like Tallmadge warn that you can ingest too much of one particular vitamin or supplement and throw off the nutritional balance of your body, which can affect the immune system. \"Get nutrients naturally through the foods you eat,\" Tallmadge says. As for vitamin pills, she recommends \"just taking a multivitamin with minerals so that all your bases are covered.\" If you think you need more of one particular supplement, talk to your doctor, she says. Although good nutrition is key for a healthy immune system, exercise is equally important. Studies have shown that moderate, regular exercise can boost the immune system. But doctors warn don't overdo it. Too much high-intensity activity, such as a marathon or triathlon, can make a person more susceptible to illness for as long as three days after the workout. Says Dr. David Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., and avid swimmer: \"Exercise gets the blood pumping, which helps our heart, our circulation system, all our muscles and organs work better. But if you do too much, in too little time, it can hurt the body.\" A daily 30-minute walk can do the trick. And don't forget to rest. A few studies point to shut-eye as a way to boost the immune system, and the National Sleep Foundation says getting the right amount of sleep is part of the \"staying well\" puzzle. Though the exact ways sleep works and how it rejuvenates the body's immune system are still a mystery, sleep experts agree that adequate rest is necessary to keep a healthy body. \"Research shows that everyone needs sleep, and that it's a critical factor in your health, weight and energy level,\" says Dr. Marc Schlosberg, a neurologist who works with the sleep lab at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, also in Washington, D.C. \"Plus, it cuts down on stress.\" Scientists and doctors have known for years that long-term, chronic stress can create negative changes at the cellular level of the body, which can severely hurt the immune system. So if you can, try to chill out. Take a break, do some yoga. Walk your dog. Pet the cat. Anything to calm the soul. As for Tatiana Gulenkina, she thinks she might have caught H1N1 flu on her campus, but she's not sure. As a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, stress is just part of a her busy life. But after a week of rest , fluids and ibuprofen, Gulenkina is feeling much better and hopes to get through the rest of the winter without other illnesses.\n","\n","(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved a new vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza. Agriflu, made by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu. The vaccine was approved using an accelerated approval process, the FDA said. Novartis demonstrated that the vaccine induces levels of antibodies in the blood that are effective in preventing seasonal influenza, but it still needs to conduct further studies. Agriflu, for ages 18 and older, is administered as a single injection in the upper arm and is available in single-dose, prefilled syringes, according to the FDA. Novartis produces another licensed vaccine for seasonal influenza, Fluvirin, approved for ages 4 and older. Although no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease, vaccination is the key to flu prevention, according to the FDA. Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said Agriflu is made in Siena, Italy, with eggs, and it has been available in Europe under the brand name Aggripal. This approval, he said, will add to future seasonal vaccine supplies.\n","\n","(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved a new vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza.

The statements questioned the safety of HPV vaccines and the rationale for the recommendations for their use from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. HPV vaccines have the promise of improving the lives of both women and men. The recommendations for use of the vaccine are based on scientific data, including safety studies, which indicate that the benefits of HPV vaccines far outweigh any of the known risks. The safety record of these vaccines is excellent. After five years and more than 35 million doses of HPV vaccines given, all of the available scientific evidence shows that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, and that the current recommendations will result in the best opportunity to prevent HPV infection and its consequences. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Studies show that 50% to 70% of women will develop an HPV infection during their sexually active lives and that infection occurs soon after they become sexually active. Although most infections resolve over six to 24 months, some persist and can lead to cancer. Certain types of HPV are responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancer, other cancers of the anal and genital areas and a significant percentage of oropharyngeal cancers in men and women. Other HPV types cause genital warts. In the United States, each year about 12,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and nearly 4,000 women die of complications of cervical cancer. HPV vaccines are an important scientific breakthrough. They prevent infection with the HPV types most commonly associated with the development of cancer and therefore are expected to reduce significantly the number of cases of HPV-related cancer in women and men. Two HPV vaccines are available in the United States. The first, Gardasil, was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 for girls 9 through 26 years of age to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts. In 2009, the license was extended to include boys 9 through 26. More recent data show Gardasil also prevents other genital cancers in women and anal cancer in both women and men. The second HPV vaccine, Cervarix, licensed in 2009 for women 10 through 25 years of age, targets the prevention of cervical and related genital cancers. Both vaccines were studied extensively before the FDA licensed them. The rationale for the recommendation to immunize at 11 through 12 is that the vaccine will be most effective if given before a person becomes sexually active. Protection is expected to last for many years. \"Catch-up\" vaccinations to age 26 are also important. Even though some persons in this age group already will have been infected with one or more of the HPV types in the vaccine, the vaccine will protect them against the HPV types in the vaccine to which they remain susceptible. By the time the FDA licenses a vaccine, common side effects are known; evaluation for adverse health effects is an important requirement of the clinical trials that lead to licensure. No serious safety concerns were detected during the clinical trials of either of the two HPV vaccines. After a vaccine is licensed, a number of systems are in place in the United States to monitor vaccine safety. These include the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a passive reporting system that can detect early-warning signals about possible new vaccine adverse effects, and the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink project, which provides a database for planned immunization safety studies of possible adverse effects arising from review of those reporting system reports and medical literature. But investigation of reports to VAERS since both HPV vaccines were licensed has suggested that rare serious allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) and fainting spells, which can occur after any immunization, can also occur after HPV vaccine. Vaccine providers, particularly when vaccinating adolescents, should consider observing patients (with patients seated or lying down) for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for injury should they faint. A recent study was conducted in CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink among females 9-26 years of age who received HPV vaccine (Gardasil). The study found no statistically significant increased risk for any of outcomes studied after vaccination. Studies on HPV vaccine safety will continue and reports of any rare event occurring after receipt of HPV vaccine will be reviewed.) And the Institute of Medicine, part of the United States National Academy of Sciences, recently reviewed reported vaccine-related, adverse events and did not find that data supported a causal relationship of HPV vaccine to any neurologic condition. Parents have a great opportunity today to reduce the risk of HPV-related cancers in their children. Parents who have concerns about HPV vaccine and some of the statements made about safety should ask their children's doctors for information. The CDC has a website that provides accurate, up-to-date information about the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines. Parents would do well to use trusted and reliable resources when making the important decision to protect their children from HPV infection and HPV-related cancers.

They are not always effective against certain viruses because not all viruses are affected by vaccines.\n","\n","---\n","Vaccines are an important medical intervention that can prevent the spread of diseases, including HPV. वे शरीर की प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली को सक्रिय करके काम करते हैं, जिससे एंटीबॉडी का उत्पादन होता है जो रोगजनकों को पहचानते हैं और उन्हें बेअसर करने का प्रयास करते हैं। When a person receives a vaccine, it stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that are ready to fight off an infection if it occurs.\n","\n","हालांकि, सभी वायरस टीकों से प्रभावित नहीं होते हैं, और कुछ वायरस टीकों की प्रभावशीलता में बाधा डालते हैं। This is because vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that are ready to fight off a particular infection. जब किसी व्यक्ति को टीके से टीका लगाया जाता है, तो यह एक विशिष्ट वायरस के खिलाफ एंटीबॉडी का उत्पादन करने के लिए प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली को उत्तेजित करता है।\n","\n","There are several reasons why certain viruses are not affected by vaccines. एक कारण यह है कि टीके सभी वायरस से निपटने के लिए नहीं बनाए गए हैं। Each virus has its own characteristics, and not all viruses have the same characteristics as the HPV virus. एच. पी. वी. वायरस में कई अलग-अलग उपभेद और उपभेद हो सकते हैं, और प्रत्येक उपभेद को टीकों द्वारा पूरी तरह से कवर नहीं किया जा सकता है। Therefore, it is challenging to develop a vaccine that covers every variation of a particular virus.\n","\n","इसके अतिरिक्त, टीके की प्रभावशीलता को प्रभावित करने वाले अन्य कारकों में टीकों की खुराक और आवृत्ति शामिल हो सकती है। For example, a certain dose of a vaccine may not be sufficient to induce a strong immune response, while another dose might be too high and cause adverse effects. टीकों की आवृत्ति भी एक भूमिका निभा सकती है, क्योंकि टीके की अधिक बार खुराक देने से प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली के अधिशेष में जाने की संभावना बढ़ सकती है और टीके की प्रभावशीलता कम हो सकती है।\n","\n","Furthermore, the individual's immune system can also affect the efficacy of a vaccine. एक व्यक्ति की प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली का एक अनूठा इतिहास हो सकता है, जिससे टीके की प्रभावशीलता में कमी आ सकती है।\n"]}],"source":["# generating the response with LLM and the knowledge from our explicitly provided data [llama-2-arxiv paper dataset]\n","response_with_rag = rag_pipeline(query)\n","\n","# print(response_with_rag)\n","for key, value in response_with_rag.items():\n","  print(f'{key}: {value}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"mgYMv_ryvgNq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Load dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"l1XqZ5zbvNY5"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2733,"status":"ok","timestamp":1712567586286,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"04491539720881734151"},"user_tz":-330},"outputId":"10eecb11-c9eb-4428-d5f5-81013306d7e4","id":"cjlLrvIOwhi9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Dataset({\n","    features: ['doi', 'chunk-id', 'chunk', 'id', 'title', 'summary', 'source', 'authors', 'categories', 'comment', 'journal_ref', 'primary_category', 'published', 'updated', 'references'],\n","    num_rows: 4838\n","})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":45}],"source":["# loading the dataset from huggingface library, which is a llama-2 papers arxiv of 4838 entries in the database\n","data = load_dataset(\n","    'jamescalam/llama-2-arxiv-papers-chunked',\n","    split='train'\n",")\n","data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"e618_PS1whjL"},"outputs":[],"source":["# first we are converting the dataset object to pandas object for better handling and manipulation.\n","data = data.to_pandas()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lso1zaB5whjL"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# using this for-loop, we iterate over each row in the dataframe, and extract the text, metadata and storing in the pinecone-index\n","batch_size=16\n","\n","for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size):\n","  i_end = min(len(data), i+batch_size)\n","  batch = data.iloc[i:i_end]\n","  ids = [f\"{x['doi']}-{x['chunk-id']}\" for i, x in batch.iterrows()]\n","  texts = [x['chunk'] for i, x in batch.iterrows()]\n","  #
