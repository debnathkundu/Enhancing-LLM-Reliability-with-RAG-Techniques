It involves propagating the error backwards through the network, adjusting the weights and biases of the layers to reduce the error.\n","\n","To do this, backpropagation first computes the error between the network's predictions and the true labels of the data. This error is then propagated backwards through the network, layer by layer, using the chain rule to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias. This process is repeated for multiple iterations, with the network's weights and biases adjusted at each iteration to reduce the error.\n","\n","In addition to propagating the error backwards through the network, backpropagation also involves propagating the error in the forward direction. This is done by computing the output of the network for a given input, and then computing the error between the predicted output and the true label of the data. This error is then used to update the weights and biases of the network to improve its performance.\n","\n","Overall, backpropagation is a powerful technique for training artificial neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns in data and make accurate predictions.\n"]}],"source":["# generating the response with LLM and the knowledge from our explicitly provided data [llama-2-arxiv paper dataset]\n","response_with_rag = rag_pipeline(query)\n","\n","# print(response_with_rag)\n","for key, value in response_with_rag.items():\n","  print(f'{key}: {value}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##5"],"metadata":{"id":"oi9Us0B6cejj"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"metadata":{"id":"Z2JxaZDDcejy","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712422300372,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":45317,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"}},"outputId":"8910bd76-bd99-4924-e5b4-78ea57d55e7a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Which novel coronavirus caused the COVID-19 pandemic?\n"," everybody was talking about the novel coronavirus that was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\n","The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

Radioactivity is a spontaneous process in which the nucleus of an atom decays, releasing energy in the form of radiation. Radioactivity can occur in any atom that has an unstable nucleus, but it is most commonly associated with isotopes of elements such as uranium, thorium, and radon. There are three main types of radioactivity: alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Alpha radiation is the heaviest and least penetrating of the three, while beta radiation is lighter and more penetrating. Gamma radiation is the lightest and most penetrating of the three. Radioactivity can have both beneficial and harmful effects on living organisms and the environment. On the beneficial side, radioactivity can be used in medical treatments, such as cancer therapy, and in food irradiation to kill bacteria and extend the shelf life of food. However, radioactivity can also have harmful effects, such as causing genetic mutations and increasing the risk of cancer. Radioactivity can also contaminate the environment, leading to long-term health effects and environmental damage.

How can you protect yourself? And should RF emission information be listed on cell phone packaging, and in stores? First things first: The WHO study did not say \"cell phones cause brain cancer.\" Rather, there is some evidence indicating a possible connection -- and while not conclusive, it warrants further study. Consequently, WHO has now categorized radio frequency electromagnetic fields as a \"group 2B\" possible human carcinogen. Here's how Ed Yong, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, explained it in his detailed analysis of the WHO announcement: . \"Group 2B means that there is some evidence for a risk but it's not that convincing. This group ends up being a bit of a catch-all category, and includes everything from carpentry to chloroform.\" Dr. Gupta: Cell phones, brain tumors . So it's worth being aware of this classification -- just as you should be mindful of your intake of coffee, another group 2B carcinogen. But this announcement is not a reason to panic. Would labels help? San Francisco has been wrestling with whether to require cell phones to be labeled for their RF emissions. Last year, the city tried to mandate cell phone radiation labeling in stores, originally to take effect February 2011. But according to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"implementation was delayed until May 1, then June 15. There now is no proposed start date.\" The city backtracked on this partly out of concern over a lawsuit filed by the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association -- but also because officials didn't know how to ensure the accuracy of the labels. Scientists aren't sure what's the most realistic, intuitive way to communicate cell phone RF emissions to consumers. Specific absorption rate, a measure of the rate of RF energy that your body absorbs from the phone, is the most commonly cited benchmark. For a phone to be certified by the FCC and sold in the U.S., for example, its maximum SAR level must be less than 1.6 watts per kilogram. But Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at University of California, Berkeley, told the Chronicle that \"specific absorption rate isn't a very useful measure because it's the peak reading on a variety of tests conducted on cell phones to measure their radiation, but doesn't indicate the average amount of radiation a user would generally be exposed to.\" He likened it to a car's gas mileage being reported only based on driving it up a steep hill. Such a measurement could actually make a car shopper avoid a hybrid because it doesn't perform well on hills, even though it would generally consume less gas. CNET recently updated its guide to cell phone radiation levels, which ranks phones according to SAR. Cell phones and radiation: The 10 highest- and lowest-emitting models . What cell phone users can do . If you are concerned that cell phones might increase your cancer risk, probably the best way to put the WHO announcement to good use is to minimize how much you hold your cell phone next to your head. More tips on minimizing cell phone radiation . Your best bet is to use a headset that physically plugs in to your phone, such as earbuds with a microphone attached. Unlike Bluetooth headsets, this entails no additional RF exposure near your head -- although it may take a moment to connect your headset to your phone. While the WHO examined only the possible risk of brain cancer, you can further reduce your cell phone RF exposure by placing your phone a few inches away from your body while using it -- such as in a purse or on the table. Or whenever possible, talk via your phone's speaker function, or send a text message instead of placing a call.

Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that high levels of radioactive substances were found in seawater near the plant, but said that the results did not represent a threat to human health. \"There should be no immediate health impact. If this situation continues for a long period of time, some impact can occur,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. The impact such radiation could have on marine life was unclear. Japanese authorities were scheduled to measure radioactivity in waters around the plant on Tuesday and Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Earlier seawater radiation monitoring detected levels of iodine-131 that were 126.7 times higher than government-set standards, the electric company said on its website. Its monitors detected cesium-134, which has a half-life of about two years, about 24.8 times higher than the government standards. Cesium-137 was found to be 16.5 times higher than the standard. The electric company detected these levels in seawater 100 meters (328 feet) south of the nuclear power plant Monday afternoon. Radioactive particles disperse in the ocean, and the farther away from the shore a sample is taken, the less concentrated the contamination should be. Because of the huge amount of dilution that happens in the ocean, there's not much chance of deep-water fish being tainted, said Murray McBride, a professor at Cornell University who studies soil and water contamination. \"I think the ocean can handle that a lot better than the physical environment and population centers,\" said Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a CNN consultant. \"We don't want any of this to happen, but better it go out to sea than stay in Japan.\" Winds have largely blown radioactive material emitted by the plant offshore since an earthquake and tsunami crippled cooling systems at the plant March 11. But tests have detected contamination of food grown near the plant. The Japanese government has banned the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture, where the plant is located, and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards, the country's health ministry reported. And officials in Fukushima halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture. The government has also banned sales of spinach and milk from parts of Gunma and Tochigi Prefectures, according to the prime minister's office. On Tuesday Edano said contamination had not been detected in other agricultural products. \"The products which are being grown in these areas are being monitored and the monitoring will continue,\" he said. He urged consumers to \"try not to panic,\" noting that the government had stopped shipments of any farm products they believed could be contaminated. Edano has stressed that officials believe the levels of radiation in food -- while above the legal standards -- do not pose any immediate health risk, saying they were mostly dangerous only if consumed repeatedly over one's lifetime. On Monday a spokesman for the World Health Organization said short-term exposure to food contaminated by radiation from Japan's damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant poses no immediate health risk. Tests have also detected radiation in tap water. On Monday, authorities in the village of Iitake urged residents to avoid drinking tap water that tests showed contained more than three times the maximum standard of radioactive iodine. Water in other jurisdictions showed lesser signs of contamination, although far below levels of concern under Japanese law, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency website. The U.N. agency said it had received reports from Japan's government that six out of 46 samples tested positive for the iodine-131 radioactive isotope. Iodine and cesium isotopes are byproducts of nuclear fission in reactors such as the ones damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Honshu, Japan's main island. Although iodine-131 has a radioactive half-life of eight days, cesium-137's half-life is about 30 years. The decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake, tsunami and other potential fallout from the Fukushima plant. Edano has said farmers will be compensated for revenue lost by the restrictions. \"Primarily this is due to the nuclear reactor accident, so we assume (Tokyo Electric Power Company) will be held responsible for compensation. The government might take some supplementary action,\" he said. Fukushima ranks among Japan's top producer of fruits, vegetables and rice. Ibaraki, south of Fukushima, supplies Tokyo with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is Japan's third-largest pork producer. For radiation to be an issue for rice, the contamination would have to be more severe and prolonged that what has been seen so far, said McBride, the Cornell University professor. Soil contamination was a huge issue around Chernobyl, but the radiation emitted from the Fukushima Daiichi plant isn't anywhere near that level, he said. \"We're not at that stage; that's the scenario you have to consider if contamination gets severe enough,\" McBride said. CNN's Jo Kent, Steven Jiang, Martin Savidge, Paul Ferguson, Thom Patterson, Matt Smith and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.\n","\n","(CNN) -- Tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the USS Ronald Reagan after conducting disaster relief missions in Japan, the military said Monday. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. In addition, the Navy said the U.S. 7th Fleet has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after detecting low-level contamination in the air and on its planes in the area, the Navy said. One ship was operating about 100 miles northeast of the power plant when \"airborne radioactivity\" was detected, the Navy said. The Navy's statement, however, provided some perspective, noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by personnel when the ship passed through the area was \"less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks, soil, and the sun.\" On Sunday, the USS Ronald Reagan started delivering aid in the coastal regions of Japan's Miyagi prefecture. Crew members, in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces, conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets. Eight U.S. and Japanese helicopters were used to distribute the pallets, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley of U.S. Forces Japan. Workers are scrambling to cool down fuel rods and prevent a full meltdown in three reactors at the earthquake-hit plant. Radioactive steam has been released, intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the reactors.\n","\n","ogTMJZL5XZAJD8TXa/sV/wZ8CoJFqSMFmh0vUknkTRP7TrlROt24GcmKogyjHIYu51cQ0bokPShbakgKeiomCUb43OrJLgnlX3C4Jn6e6MgqdajNLaTKTEDvexNxf+8dm56tahgIssNCDo/1Ms5NhJPa8IJUzY7H1lCqGL2r5gOiCLUdqBdW0KwHHmVhNXKVSW4rZbrtUUbJXSKztAFCtAlqqMb1EAhougJvaA39O48O6/Oh/M5H11zFjsn6A+cyTfnKaEK</latexit>activity\n","\n","Question: Describe radioactivity\n","Helpful Answer: Radioactivity is the process of emitting radiation from an atomic nucleus. It occurs when an atom's nucleus is unstable and decays into a more stable form, releasing energy in the form of radiation. There are two types of radioactivity: alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Alpha radiation is made up of alpha particles, which are high-energy heavy ions that can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air. Beta radiation is made up of beta particles, which are electrons that have been ejected from an atom's nucleus. Gamma radiation is high-energy electromagnetic radiation, similar to X-rays. Radioactivity is used in medicine, industry, and scientific research. In medicine, radioactive isotopes are used to diagnose and treat diseases, such as cancer. In industry, radioactive materials are used to sterilize medical instruments and to test the quality of materials. In scientific research, radioactivity is used to study the structure of atoms and molecules, and to understand the fundamental laws of nature.\n"]}],"source":["# generating the response with LLM and the knowledge from our explicitly provided data [llama-2-arxiv paper dataset]\n","response_with_rag = rag_pipeline(query)\n","\n","# print(response_with_rag)\n","for key, value in response_with_rag.items():\n","  print(f'{key}: {value}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"7K_6hQCLdLwV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712425476473,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"}}},"execution_count":53,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3"],"metadata":{"id":"RtkzVKtvgFPD"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712512003669,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":22568,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"}},"outputId":"d44213d1-f82b-4302-bed3-893a7b2e3bed","id":"VDqXdVjggFPR"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Can you confirm if TATA is the IPL Sponsor?\n"," nobody knows, but I can tell you that the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a Twenty20 cricket league that was founded in 2008.

Danish Kaneria, in action against India last December, was hoping to play in the Indian Premier League. Stars from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies and, for the first time, England will be competing in the action that starts on April 10. Several Pakistan stars had also signed for IPL franchises while another five, including leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, were scheduled to appear at a players' auction to be held in Goa, India, on Thursday. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said players would not be allowed to play in the IPL this coming season on government advice. \"We have informed the IPL and Indian board that our players can't take part in the IPL this year,\" PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf told Reuters.com. The decision follows concerns for players' safety because of the tense relations between Pakistan and India after the Mumbai militant attacks in November. Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, who plays for Delhi, said the players would abide by the directives of the government and PCB. Meanwhile, another former captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq is among several top Pakistan players who have successfully challenged a domestic ban imposed following appearances in the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). Provincial Sindh High Court on Monday suspended the 2007 action taken by the PCB which must appear in court later this month to explain their action. Players affected by the 2007 ruling also include Mohammad Yousuf, Imran Nazir, Mohammad Sami and Azhar Mahmood who along with Inzamam, played for Lahore Badshahs. Last year, the Badshahs named after a Pakistani city and with a number of Pakistani players won the ICL 20s Indian championship. \"The honorable court has suspended this relevant clause of the PCB rules and allowed the players to appear in domestic cricket with immediate effect,\" Zahid Fakhruddin Ibrahim, the legal counsel for the players, told Reuters.com. Lahore coach Moin Khan, a former Pakistan captain, said the suspension of the ban was good for Pakistani cricket. \"Some of the ICL players can still play for Pakistan and when they play in domestic cricket, youngsters will learn from them,\" Khan commented. \"The ban had hurt the players financially as well as cricket-wise, so it's a great decision.\"\n","\n","NEW DELHI (CNN) -- India's Tata Motors Monday announced it would begin delivery of the Nano, billed as the world's \"cheapest car\", in July.

Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were meeting in Paris Monday to discuss ways to safeguard the euro by increasing economic and political \"convergence.\" \"Germany and France are the two big economies of Europe. To risk us diverging is to risk us destroying Europe. The crisis requires of us an extra commitment for unity and Europe will not redo the mistakes of the past,\" Sarkozy said after their meeting. The two leaders agreed on a new fiscal pact that they say will help prevent another debt crisis. The pact, which will be presented in detail at a meeting of European leaders later this week, will involve amending or rewriting the treaties that govern the European Union, the leaders said. The leaders of Italy and the Netherlands met earlier Monday, and Ireland's prime minister is due to announce new budget-cutting measures later the same day. Merkel Friday told lawmakers that a fiscal union was in the works, an effort to correct a basic flaw within the EU -- that it has a common currency and shared monetary policy, but no mechanism to ensure that all members are financially sound. \"We are beginning to create the fiscal union,\" Merkel said. But she stressed that the European debt crisis will not be resolved overnight, saying the process \"will take years.\" On Thursday and Friday, government leaders from all 27 EU nations will meet in Brussels for what is expected to be the final meeting of the European Council in a year that has seen more than its fair share of such summits. Merkel and Sarkozy both said last week that a fiscal pact should be written into the EU treaty so that budget rules can be properly enforced through broader oversight and automatic penalties for nations that fail to comply. In a sign of what's at stake for the United States, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will spend most of this week in Europe to meet with top officials, including Sarkozy and the newly appointed Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti. President Barack Obama has called the crisis a serious threat to the U.S. economy, noting that Europe is one of America's biggest trading partners. While Merkel and Sarkozy agree on the need to form a fiscal union, they appear to be at odds over what that would mean. Last Friday, Merkel again ruled out the creation of eurobonds, which could drive up borrowing costs for creditworthy nations such as Germany. The European Commission has proposed issuing so-called stability bonds as part of a plan to pool government debt across Europe. Merkel also stressed that the ECB should remain independent, underscoring the deep opposition in Germany to the central bank risking inflation by printing money to prop up troubled governments. Sarkozy also said the ECB should remain independent, but he sounded much less draconian than his German counterpart. \"Naturally, the European Central Bank has a role to play,\" said Sarkozy. He did not want to debate what that role would be, but Sarkozy did say the ECB would act to prevent a deeper economic downturn in Europe. Late Sunday, Italy, which has sparked worry over its weighty debt and rising borrowing costs, unveiled a budget proposal that included â‚¬30 billion ($40 billion) in new taxes and spending cuts over two years, including reductions to future pensions. About â‚¬20 billion ($27 billion) would come from cuts, including major changes to how Italian workers' pensions are calculated and a one-year increase in retirement ages, effective in January, Monti announced Sunday night. In announcing the cuts, Monti -- who also serves as finance minister -- said he would take no salary for either position. The proposal still needs parliamentary approval.

French troops on patrol with the Afghan army as part of the NATO mission in Afghanistan. The National Assembly voted in favor of Sarkozy's plan, 329-238. Socialist Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, told Prime Minister Francois Fillon: \"You tell us this would mean more independence and more influence. It would probably mean less independence and less influence.\" The move did not technically require parliamentary approval, but the president's party scheduled the debate to give opponents a chance to voice their opinions -- and to show a majority backed it. Asking the National Assembly to vote on the issue also showed how sensitive the matter is in France. France was a founding member of the NATO alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid friction with the United States. \"To cooperate is to lose your independence,\" French President Charles de Gaulle said at the time. For the next 43 years, even though France selectively participated in NATO military operations, de Gaulle's principle remained the governing cornerstone of French foreign policy. If Paris took orders from NATO military commanders, it was reasoned, the nation would no longer have complete control of its destiny. Sarkozy, however, believes the opposite -- that cooperation in NATO is a guarantee of French independence. Rejoining NATO's military command, he argued, will give France a seat at the table for decision-making. From its earliest years, the organization's trans-Atlantic ties were strained because U.S. analysts warned that if the European allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance, they risked losing the support of the United States, according to NATO. Meanwhile, the European nations felt the United States was trying to dominate the organization, according to NATO. De Gaulle's 1966 decision meant no French forces could be under permanent allied command and that France would have no participation in defense planning. In 1995, France rejoined NATO's military committee, which advises NATO's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO's strategic commanders. While France was still not a part of the military command, it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities, including actions in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Half of all French troops outside the country are assigned to NATO military operations. Opponents of Sarkozy's move -- who include some members of his party -- believe de Gaulle, not Sarkozy, had it right. They started a last-minute petition drive to stop his march back into NATO. \"With this decision, France will return as a subordinate country and will lose its ability to represent another image in the world,\" said Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a member of the French National Assembly. The president's allies calculate Sarkozy's move will strengthen Europe's hand on defense issues. \"There will be more European weight in the way decisions will be made,\" said Louis Giscard d'Estaing, a member of the National Assembly's U.S. Friendship Committee. \"Therefore, the balance of power between the USA and Europe will be re-established within this French move.\" CNN's Sunaina Karkarey and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report .\n","\n","PARIS, France (CNN)  -- Opposition lawmakers Tuesday ridiculed President Nicolas Sarkozy for taking France back into NATO's military command after more than 40 years, but were unable to stop the move when it came to a vote.

If Paris took orders from NATO military commanders, it was reasoned, the nation would no longer have complete control of its destiny. Sarkozy, however, believes the opposite -- that cooperation in NATO is a guarantee of French independence. Rejoining NATO's military command, he argued, will give France a seat at the table for decision-making. From its earliest years, the organization's trans-Atlantic ties were strained because U.S. analysts warned that if the European allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance, they risked losing the support of the United States, according to NATO. Meanwhile, the European nations felt the United States was trying to dominate the organization, according to NATO. De Gaulle's 1966 decision meant no French forces could be under permanent allied command and that France would have no participation in defense planning. In 1995, France rejoined NATO's military committee, which advises NATO's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO's strategic commanders. While France was still not a part of the military command, it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities, including actions in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Half of all French troops outside the country are assigned to NATO military operations. Opponents of Sarkozy's move -- who include some members of his party -- believe de Gaulle, not Sarkozy, had it right. They started a last-minute petition drive to stop his march back into NATO. \"With this decision, France will return as a subordinate country and will lose its ability to represent another image in the world,\" said Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a member of the French National Assembly. The president's allies calculate Sarkozy's move will strengthen Europe's hand on defense issues. \"There will be more European weight in the way decisions will be made,\" said Louis Giscard d'Estaing, a member of the National Assembly's U.S. Friendship Committee. \"Therefore, the balance of power between the USA and Europe will be re-established within this French move.\" CNN's Sunaina Karkarey and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report .\n","\n","Paris (CNN) -- Turkey is fuming over French legislation that would criminalize any public denial of what the bill calls the Armenian genocide last century in Ottoman Turkey. \"We are reviewing our relations with France,\" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after the French National Assembly passed the so-called Armenian genocide bill. \"We will take our measures phase by phase depending on France's behavior from now on. Erdogan said Turkey is recalling its Paris ambassador for consultations to Ankara, is canceling bilateral visits, and won't cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union. \"We are stopping all kinds of political consultations with France. We are canceling bilateral military activities and joint exercises from now on. We are canceling the permission granted annually for all military overflights, landings and take-offs. We are starting permission process for every military flight individually. From today on, we are rejecting the permission requests of military ships to visit ports. We will not attend and held the bilateral Turkey-France joint economic and trade partnership committee meeting that was planned for January 2012 under the co-chairmanship of the economy ministers of the two countries,\" Erdogan said. \"I am underlining this. This is the first phase.\" The bill -- applauded by Armenians -- must now be voted on by the country's senate. Erdogan said he hopes the French Senate will vote down the bill. \"New measures will come to the agenda depending on the progress of the bill in France and we will apply them with determination without any hesitation.\" Armenian groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915, Turks committed genocide, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. But modern-day Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, arguing instead that hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. The genocide debate is an annual source of tension between Turkey and the United States, two NATO military allies. The White House annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide. \"The issue should be researched not by politicians, but by historians,\" Turkish Parliament Speaker Cemil Cicek said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told Turkish lawmakers Thursday that Turkey is a friend and ally of France and strives to maintain a dialogue. Armenia's foreign minister, Edward Nalbandian, hailed the move, saying France \"reconfirmed its high place of being the cradle of human rights and once again proved its commitment to universal human values.\" \"The French people showed that human rights are highest value, and today by adopting this bill,\" he said, indicating that crimes against humanity have no statute of limitations and deserve condemnation. According to official Turkish statistics, the volume of trade between Turkey and France from January to the end of October this year was more than $13.5 billion.

Nuclear energy isn't one of them. Every dollar spent on nuclear is one less dollar spent on clean renewable energy and one more dollar spent on making the world a comparatively dirtier and a more dangerous place, because nuclear power and nuclear weapons go hand in hand. In the November issue of Scientific American, my colleague Mark DeLucchi of the University of California-Davis and I laid out a plan to power the world with nothing but wind, water and sun. After considering the best available technologies, we decided that a combination of wind, concentrated solar, geothermal, photovoltaics, tidal, wave and hydroelectric energy could more than meet all the planet's energy needs, particularly if all the world's vehicles could be run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. We rejected nuclear for several reasons. First, it's not carbon-free, no matter what the advocates tell you. Vast amounts of fossil fuels must be burned to mine, transport and enrich uranium and to build the nuclear plant. And all that dirty power will be released during the 10 to 19 years that it takes to plan and build a nuclear plant. (A wind farm typically takes two to five years.) Stewart Brand says now is the time for nuclear power . The on-the-ground footprint of nuclear power, through its plants and uranium mines, is about 1,000 times larger than it is for wind. Wind turbines are merely poles in the ground -- with lots of space between them that can be farmed, ranched or left open -- or poles in the ocean. Geothermal energy also has a much smaller footprint than nuclear; solar only slightly more. But while geothermal, solar and wind are safe, nuclear is not. For nuclear to meet all the world's energy needs today -- 12.5  terawatts (1 terawatt = 1 trillion watts) -- more than 17,000 nuclear plants would be needed. Even if nuclear were only 5 percent of the solution, most countries would have nuclear plants. What's worse, the nuclear industry wants to reprocess waste to obtain more energy from increasingly scarce uranium. But this only produces more weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. A global push toward nuclear energy would mean that uranium enrichment -- and efforts at nuclear weapons development -- would certainly grow throughout the world.. Nuclear proponents argue that not enough clean renewables exist to power the world. However, part of our work at Stanford University has been to map world renewable energy resources. Enough wind and solar exist in high-wind and sunny locations over land to power the world for all purposes multiple times over. There is no shortage. Nuclear proponents also argue that nuclear energy production is constant, unlike fickle winds and sunshine. But worldwide, nuclear plants are down 15 percent of the time, and when a plant goes down, so does a large fraction of the grid. Connecting wind farms over large areas through transmission lines smoothes power supply. Combining geothermal with wind (whose power potential often peaks at night) and solar (which peaks by day), and using hydroelectricity to fill in gaps, would almost always match demand. Converting to electric vehicles and using smart charging practices would also help to match supply with demand. So would storing energy (with concentrated solar) and giving people incentives to reduce demand. It is not rocket science to match power demand. It merely requires thinking out of the box. Finally, the costs of land-based wind, geothermal and hydroelectricity are competitive with conventional new sources of electricity; costs of solar and wind over the ocean are higher but declining. Costs of nuclear have historically been underestimated. In sum, if we invest in nuclear versus true renewables, you can bet that the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting while we wait, and wait, for the nuclear age to arrive. We will also guarantee a riskier future for us all. There is no need for nuclear. The world can be powered by wind, water and sun alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Z. Jacobson.\n","\n","Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- The massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has triggered heated debate about where the United States gets its energy supplies. Some say domestic drilling is necessary to avoid U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Others say the country needs to look to other fuel sources. But one man has found his own solution. Patrick Vanderwyden uses solar power to run his water heater, hot tub, air conditioner, fans, and his refrigerator at his home of 24 years. Three years ago, the self-described New Age hippie began a personal mission to cut his energy usage by switching to alternative energy. \"What I do now has an effect on future generations,\" said Vanderwyden, 49. \"I don't want to leave future generations with a real problem if I can help it. And I think I can.\" The sun also powers most of Vanderwyden's transportation. On any given day the conservationist can be seen throughout town quietly driving something with pedals or an electric motor. He has a collection of recycled bikes, an electric cycle and one bike fashioned from spare parts that he calls \"Frankenbike.\" Vanderwyden carefully drives the strange-looking contraption, powered by a treadmill motor, since it can easily exceed the top legal speed of 18 mph allowed for electric bikes, he said. He also has in his arsenal of alternative vehicles a Chevrolet pickup truck with an electric motor. Vanderwyden stumbled upon the truck for sale on the internet auction site eBay. It already had been converted by a New Jersey electric company. He says he reduced his energy use by nearly 30 percent last year compared with the year before. That's in contrast to worldwide energy consumption, which has continued to rise for decades. \"What was started in the '70s was turned off in the '80s as far as the conservation and the use of renewable energy,\" said Vanderwyden. The U.S. Department of Energy reports that demand for oil has almost doubled since 1970 and the demand will continue to increase for decades to come. Oil accounts for more than one-third of U.S. energy use. The Energy Department statistics show that in 2008, the vast majority of America's petroleum use went toward consumer vehicles, commercial vehicles and air travel. Fuel-efficient hybrid cars only account for a small percentage of cars sold today, although the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Institute predicted that by 2035, alternative fuel cars will account for more than half of the cars bought. Critics of electric vehicles point out that electricity is mainly produced by coal-powered plants which, in turn, create large amounts of greenhouse gases. Acknowleging that concern, Vanderwyden said he reduces how often he drives his electric pickup truck. Instead, Vanderwyden drives his electric bike charged from his solar panels as often as possible. The conservationist admits his actions are extreme but says if everyone would reduce their energy use a little, \"all of us together would make an impact.\" \"I'm sad about this oil spill, but at least it's bringing some attention to this issue again,\" he said. \"I really hope that [it] gets people to understand that it's our demand that ... makes them want to drill a mile deep in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n","\n","(CNN) -- Anything can still happen at the quake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at Japan, but experts are hopeful that the situation will stabilize. In the best-case scenario, electrical power and cooling would be restored to all of the six units of the plant, said Tom Kauffman, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a policy organization of the nuclear energy and technologies industry in Washington. Restoring electric power is essential to stabilizing the plant, said Michael Golay, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Power would ensure that the water can be provided to cover the fuel. Workers hope to install a crucial panel at an annex building, which was not severely affected by last Friday's post-earthquake tsunami, for a new power supply system that should be finished Friday morning, an official from the Tokyo Power Company said Friday morning. The improvised power system, using 1.5 kilometers total of cable, is expected to provide electricity to power the cooling systems for the Nos. 1 and 2 reactors at the plant. Also, engineers got an emergency diesel generator for Unit 6 running, and it is supplying power to Units 5 and 6, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said Friday. Water injection to the spent fuel pool was continuing. \"Obviously what we're hoping for is that they will bring the various cooling problems under control in the very near future,\" said Ian Hutchinson, professor of nuclear science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Once the fuel rods are submerged in water, the large releases of radioactive materials should come to an end, Hutchinson said. When the cooling water is restored to the spent fuel pools, and the reactor is cooling and the flooding can be maintained, expectations are for a stabilization of the situation, and a major reduction of radiation emissions, he said. \"That's when we'll be able to say, 'We've got this under control,'\" Hutchinson said. Once it's been under control for a week or two, things may stabilize. The whole cleanup would take a matter of months or even years, Hutchinson said. And the site won't be usable again, said Gary Was, professor in the department of materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan. Even in the best case scenario, there will be melted fuel in the reactor that's not going to be usable, Was said. A real concern is the after-heat arising in the fuel rods, which need to have water cooling them, Hutchinson said. Unless there are much bigger releases and contaminations near the site, people may one day be able to safely get closer to Fukushima Daiichi than the current established evacuation zones, Golay said. The United States government has instructed Americans to stay 50 miles from the plant; for Japanese citizens, the evacuation zone is only about 12 miles. \"The fact that you have differing policies doesn't mean the U.S. thinks it's more dangerous,\" Golay said. It's simply because the U.S. is not in a position to help its citizens in Japan, he said. The situation at Fukushima Daiichi is worse than Three Mile Island, the Pennsylvania plant that suffered a partial core meltdown in one of its reactors in 1979, Golay said. That's because at Fukushima Daiichi there's more radioactive material involved, and it's less contained he said. At the Chernobyl disaster, the world's worst nuclear power plant accident, which occurred in 1986, the facility had to be sealed off with a large concrete sarcophagus. It's hard to say whether this will need to happen at Fukushima Daiichi, experts say. It all depends on the extent of the contamination, which is unknown, Was said. Sealing off Three Mile Island was also discussed at the time of that disaster, Kauffman said, but instead the reactor was cleaned out, with the damaged fuel and core debris shipped off-site and put into storage. \"We're still in the wait-and-see mode,\" Kauffman said.\n","\n","(CNN) -- Japanese authorities are expected to announce Friday that a \"cold shutdown\" has been achieved at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That would mean the plant's crippled reactors have stayed at temperatures below the boiling point for some time. The announcement is a symbolic milestone. But experts say it will take years -- perhaps decades -- to fully clean up the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. The plume of radioactive particles that spewed from Fukushima Daiichi -- where reactor cooling systems failed in the aftermath of Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami in March -- displaced about 80,000 people who lived within a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) radius of the plant, as well as residents of one village as far as 40 kilometers to the northwest. The government has yet to determine when those evacuated can return to their homes. Significant work -- with significant risks -- remains to be done at the plant. \"This is far from over, and the work will go on for a long time,\" Tokyo Electric Power Co. President Toshio Nishizawa told CNN this week. Citing government sources, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported Thursday that scrapping crippled reactors at the plant could take up to 40 years. In October, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric -- which owns the plant -- said temperatures in the three reactors where meltdowns occurred had already been brought down below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), but the company would have to maintain those conditions for some time before declaring the reactors in cold shutdown. \"They're making this out to be some big milestone, some big thing. But the reality of this is that it's not,\" said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. \"The problem is, with these reactors and the condition that they're in, to suggest that they're in cold shutdown really doesn't do justice to the situation. They're no safer today than they were basically in June.\" Officials could start removing spent fuel rods from the facility next year, but it could be up to a decade before they are able to access the reactor vessels, he said. \"They'll probably spend two or three years studying it,\" he said. Jack DeVine, who helped lead the cleanup of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant after the 1979 partial meltdown there, said the cold shutdown likely means officials may have one less thing to worry about. If they don't have to use as much water to cool the reactors, they also don't have to worry about what to do with contaminated cooling water -- one of many problems that have plagued workers at the crippled plant. \"It's not like there's a dramatic difference. It's just a gradual incremental difference that does make life easier,\" he said. The earthquake and tsunami on March 11 killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern Japan. The country was on edge for weeks as cooling systems failed and utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a nuclear catastrophe at the six-reactor Daiichi plant, located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Hydrogen explosions blew apart the No. 1 and No. 3 reactor housings, while another hydrogen blast is suspected to have damaged the No. 2 reactor. Fires believed caused by heat from the No. 4 spent fuel pool damaged that unit's reactor building. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency eventually categorized the accident as a level-7 event -- the highest level on an international scale for nuclear disasters -- putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. \"We are going to check each reactor properly and determine what is going to happen to those left,\" Nishizawa, the Tokyo Electric president, said Wednesday. Removing spent fuel rods is the next step, but officials need to further survey the area before that happens, he said. \"We are considering sending a robot into the fuel tanks to really have a good idea (about) the situation. This will be necessary when we take out the fuel,\" Nishizawa said. \"But I don't believe what we see will be 180 degrees different from our simulations. But as we say, seeing once is better than hearing 100 times, so we will have a good look at what's happening inside.\" At Three Mile Island, where damage was less severe and only one reactor was affected, it took two and half years before officials were able to get inside the reactor to assess it, DeVine said. At Fukushima Daiichi, that process will likely take much longer, he said. \"I think in terms of what's ahead, it's still the daunting task that it's always been, which is first of all, figuring out where everything is. ... They're going to be searching for and finding pieces of fuel, chunks of molten material that have now cooled, through all of that rubble,\" he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Matt Smith in Atlanta, and Licia Yee in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n","\n","Question: Can you energy be destroyed?.\n","Helpful Answer: No, energy cannot be destroyed.

Energy can take many forms, such as thermal, kinetic, potential, electrical, chemical, and more. When energy is converted from one form to another, some of the energy may be lost as heat or other forms of energy that are not usable. However, the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant, as energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted.

One trillion $1 bills stacked one on top of the other would reach nearly 68,000 miles into the sky. A billion is a thousand million, and a trillion is a thousand billion. To provide some perspective on just how big a trillion dollars is, think about it like this: A trillion dollars is the number 1 followed by 12 zeroes. Or you can think of it this way: One trillion $1 bills stacked one on top of the other would reach nearly 68,000 miles (about 109,400 kilometers) into the sky, or about a third of the way from the Earth to the moon. Some Republicans are hardly over the moon about the growing size of the proposed economic stimulus plan. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said this week that Americans have become desensitized to just how much money that is. \"To put a trillion dollars in context, if you spend a million dollars every day since Jesus was born, you still wouldn't have spent a trillion,\" McConnell said. CNN checked McConnell's numbers with noted Temple University math professor and author John Allen Paulos. \"A million dollars a day for 2,000 years is only three-quarters of a trillion dollars. It's a big number no matter how you slice it,\" Paulos said. Here's another way to look at it. \"A million seconds is about 11½ days. A billion seconds is about 32 years, and a trillion seconds is 32,000 years,\" Paulos said. \"People tend to lump them together, perhaps because they rhyme, but if you think of it in terms of a jail sentence, do you want to go to jail for 11½ days or 32 years or maybe 32,000 years? So, they're vastly different, and people generally don't really have a real visceral grasp of the differences among them.\" Everyone is tossing around the words million, billion and trillion. With the national debt now topping $10 trillion, following a $700 billion bank rescue and proposed $800 billion-plus stimulus package, have we become numb to the numbers?  How much is a trillion? » . \" 'Number' itself can be parsed 'number' or 'numb-er.' And maybe in this case, the latter is a better pronunciation,\" Paulos said. \"I think to some extent, we have ... evolved in a context where such big numbers were completely foreign.\" Perhaps a better way to get a \"grasp of the numbers,\" Paulos said, is to use them to describe the budgets of government programs. \"The [Environmental Protection Agency's], for example, annual budget is about $7.5 billion. So, a trillion dollars would fund the EPA in present dollars for 130 years -- more than a century. Or the National Science Foundation or National Cancer Institute have budgets of $5 [billion] or $6 billion. You could fund those for almost 200 years,\" he said. Times have certainly changed. Back in 1993, President Bill Clinton wanted a $30 billion jobs and investment package. He didn't get it. Just last year, President George W. Bush signed an emergency economic stimulus of $168 billion --- a tally that seems paltry compared with the amount requested today. The economic problem, many say, demands huge spending. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has called it \"the mother of all crises.\" The numbers are big, but so is the United States economy. The gross domestic product, which measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country, is about $14 trillion. Still, many wonder if we can afford it.   \"So we do have a big economy that may not be as vibrant as it was, but it is still a powerful economic engine. Knock on wood, we'll see what happens,\"  said Paulos.  Last week, the House passed an $819 billion emergency stimulus, and the Senate version is approaching $900 billion. In the end, whatever lawmakers hash out probably won't reach $1 trillion. But consider this: If all of the financial market interventions, loans, guarantees, bailouts and rescues are approved, they will total more than $7 trillion.\n","\n","2D Conv.

Tired with a headache and high fever, Gulenkina knew she was coming down with something. Yet she wasn't sure with what. Besides getting vaccinated, there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick. \"My symptoms were apparently the same as for regular flu: coughs, sneezes, high temperature, sore throat and headache.\" she says. But when her boyfriend took her to the doctor, her diagnosis was a little little bit of a shock. \"I had the swine flu!\" Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped counting the number of reported H1N1 virus incidents in this country, the American Medical Association says many of its members are starting to see more cases of the illness, along with early bouts of seasonal flu and colds. It's just that time of year when a lot of nasty bugs are out there. So the question is, what's the best way to protect yourself? Health experts will tell you the most effective way to fight the flu, including the H1N1 virus, is to get vaccinated, which causes your own body to make antibodies that target specific illnesses. After immunization, it takes up to 10 days for the vaccines to take effect. But there are other ways to boost your immune system to ward off being sick during the winter. Why boost your immune system? It's what protects you from diseases. It's designed to defend the body against millions of toxins, parasites, bacteria and microbes that would love to invade the body and make it their home. But in order to protect you, your immune system has to be healthy. If it begins to break down, then germs can attack and cause you to become ill. That's why taking care of your immune system, especially this time of year, is a must. And the best way to start is with good nutrition. You need to eat the right foods. \"Your nutrition profoundly affects your ability to fight these diseases,\" notes Katherine Tallmadge, national spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. That means fill up your plate with lean protein, including chicken, fish and fat-free dairy products. Why protein? \"The molecules that fight disease are made of protein,\" Tallmadge says. Watch more on how to rev up your immune system » . And think fats. Good fats. Certain fats improve cellular function and the ability to fight disease. For instance, when people eat more liquid oils, as opposed to hard, saturated fats, the fats end up in their cell walls. With liquid oils predominantly in the diet, cells are more flexible, communicate better and are more able to fight disease . \"More olive oil, canola oil and nuts. These are healthy fats,\" says Tallmadge. Tallmadge also reminds us to include fruits, vegetables and whole grains in our diet. These contain important antioxidants that keep your blood levels of vitamin C, beta-carotene, zinc and B-vitamins high. Which also means think vitamin supplements. But not too many. Nutritionists like Tallmadge warn that you can ingest too much of one particular vitamin or supplement and throw off the nutritional balance of your body, which can affect the immune system. \"Get nutrients naturally through the foods you eat,\" Tallmadge says. As for vitamin pills, she recommends \"just taking a multivitamin with minerals so that all your bases are covered.\" If you think you need more of one particular supplement, talk to your doctor, she says. Although good nutrition is key for a healthy immune system, exercise is equally important. Studies have shown that moderate, regular exercise can boost the immune system. But doctors warn don't overdo it. Too much high-intensity activity, such as a marathon or triathlon, can make a person more susceptible to illness for as long as three days after the workout. Says Dr. David Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., and avid swimmer: \"Exercise gets the blood pumping, which helps our heart, our circulation system, all our muscles and organs work better. But if you do too much, in too little time, it can hurt the body.\" A daily 30-minute walk can do the trick. And don't forget to rest. A few studies point to shut-eye as a way to boost the immune system, and the National Sleep Foundation says getting the right amount of sleep is part of the \"staying well\" puzzle. Though the exact ways sleep works and how it rejuvenates the body's immune system are still a mystery, sleep experts agree that adequate rest is necessary to keep a healthy body. \"Research shows that everyone needs sleep, and that it's a critical factor in your health, weight and energy level,\" says Dr. Marc Schlosberg, a neurologist who works with the sleep lab at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, also in Washington, D.C. \"Plus, it cuts down on stress.\" Scientists and doctors have known for years that long-term, chronic stress can create negative changes at the cellular level of the body, which can severely hurt the immune system. So if you can, try to chill out. Take a break, do some yoga. Walk your dog. Pet the cat. Anything to calm the soul. As for Tatiana Gulenkina, she thinks she might have caught H1N1 flu on her campus, but she's not sure. As a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, stress is just part of a her busy life. But after a week of rest , fluids and ibuprofen, Gulenkina is feeling much better and hopes to get through the rest of the winter without other illnesses.\n","\n","(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved a new vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza.

The statements questioned the safety of HPV vaccines and the rationale for the recommendations for their use from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. HPV vaccines have the promise of improving the lives of both women and men. The recommendations for use of the vaccine are based on scientific data, including safety studies, which indicate that the benefits of HPV vaccines far outweigh any of the known risks. The safety record of these vaccines is excellent. After five years and more than 35 million doses of HPV vaccines given, all of the available scientific evidence shows that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, and that the current recommendations will result in the best opportunity to prevent HPV infection and its consequences. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Studies show that 50% to 70% of women will develop an HPV infection during their sexually active lives and that infection occurs soon after they become sexually active. Although most infections resolve over six to 24 months, some persist and can lead to cancer. Certain types of HPV are responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancer, other cancers of the anal and genital areas and a significant percentage of oropharyngeal cancers in men and women. Other HPV types cause genital warts. In the United States, each year about 12,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and nearly 4,000 women die of complications of cervical cancer. HPV vaccines are an important scientific breakthrough. They prevent infection with the HPV types most commonly associated with the development of cancer and therefore are expected to reduce significantly the number of cases of HPV-related cancer in women and men. Two HPV vaccines are available in the United States. The first, Gardasil, was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 for girls 9 through 26 years of age to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts. In 2009, the license was extended to include boys 9 through 26. More recent data show Gardasil also prevents other genital cancers in women and anal cancer in both women and men. The second HPV vaccine, Cervarix, licensed in 2009 for women 10 through 25 years of age, targets the prevention of cervical and related genital cancers. Both vaccines were studied extensively before the FDA licensed them. The rationale for the recommendation to immunize at 11 through 12 is that the vaccine will be most effective if given before a person becomes sexually active. Protection is expected to last for many years. \"Catch-up\" vaccinations to age 26 are also important. Even though some persons in this age group already will have been infected with one or more of the HPV types in the vaccine, the vaccine will protect them against the HPV types in the vaccine to which they remain susceptible. By the time the FDA licenses a vaccine, common side effects are known; evaluation for adverse health effects is an important requirement of the clinical trials that lead to licensure. No serious safety concerns were detected during the clinical trials of either of the two HPV vaccines. After a vaccine is licensed, a number of systems are in place in the United States to monitor vaccine safety. These include the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a passive reporting system that can detect early-warning signals about possible new vaccine adverse effects, and the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink project, which provides a database for planned immunization safety studies of possible adverse effects arising from review of those reporting system reports and medical literature. But investigation of reports to VAERS since both HPV vaccines were licensed has suggested that rare serious allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) and fainting spells, which can occur after any immunization, can also occur after HPV vaccine. Vaccine providers, particularly when vaccinating adolescents, should consider observing patients (with patients seated or lying down) for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for injury should they faint. A recent study was conducted in CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink among females 9-26 years of age who received HPV vaccine (Gardasil). The study found no statistically significant increased risk for any of outcomes studied after vaccination. Studies on HPV vaccine safety will continue and reports of any rare event occurring after receipt of HPV vaccine will be reviewed.) And the Institute of Medicine, part of the United States National Academy of Sciences, recently reviewed reported vaccine-related, adverse events and did not find that data supported a causal relationship of HPV vaccine to any neurologic condition. Parents have a great opportunity today to reduce the risk of HPV-related cancers in their children. Parents who have concerns about HPV vaccine and some of the statements made about safety should ask their children's doctors for information. The CDC has a website that provides accurate, up-to-date information about the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines. Parents would do well to use trusted and reliable resources when making the important decision to protect their children from HPV infection and HPV-related cancers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joseph Bocchini.\n","\n","Question: How do vaccines work to prevent diseases, and why are they sometimes ineffective against certain viruses?\n","Helpful Answer: Vaccines work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a disease-causing virus or bacteria to the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize and fight off the real thing. The antibodies remain in the body and can provide protection against future infections. However, vaccines are not 100% effective against all diseases, and some viruses are particularly good at evading the immune system. For example, the H1N1 virus that caused the 2009 pandemic was able to mutate quickly and evade the immune system, making it difficult to develop an effective vaccine. Additionally, some people may not develop a strong immune response to a vaccine, which can reduce its effectiveness. Overall, while vaccines are an important tool in preventing diseases, they are not a guarantee against getting sick, and it's important to continue practicing good hygiene and taking other precautions to stay healthy.\n"]}],"source":["# generating the response with LLM and the knowledge from our explicitly provided data [llama-2-arxiv paper dataset]\n","response_with_rag = rag_pipeline(query)\n","\n","# print(response_with_rag)\n","for key, value in response_with_rag.items():\n","  print(f'{key}: {value}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"mgYMv_ryvgNq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712513398725,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"}}},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Load dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"l1XqZ5zbvNY5"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":46,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1961,"status":"ok","timestamp":1712513498808,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"},"user_tz":-330},"outputId":"35a58a33-00d2-4ea5-dc83-c53655d2fcc2","id":"cjlLrvIOwhi9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Dataset({\n","    features: ['doi', 'chunk-id', 'chunk', 'id', 'title', 'summary', 'source', 'authors', 'categories', 'comment', 'journal_ref', 'primary_category', 'published', 'updated', 'references'],\n","    num_rows: 4838\n","})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":46}],"source":["# loading the dataset from huggingface library, which is a llama-2 papers arxiv of 4838 entries in the database\n","data = load_dataset(\n","    'jamescalam/llama-2-arxiv-papers-chunked',\n","    split='train'\n",")\n","data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":47,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712513499395,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"}},"id":"e618_PS1whjL"},"outputs":[],"source":["# first we are converting the dataset object to pandas object for better handling and manipulation.\n","data = data.to_pandas()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":48,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":71828,"status":"ok","timestamp":1712513571739,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"lso1zaB5whjL"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# using this for-loop, we iterate over each row in the dataframe, and extract the text, metadata and storing in the pinecone-index\n","batch_size=16\n","\n","for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size):\n","  i_end = min(len(data), i+batch_size)\n","  batch = data.iloc[i:i_end]\n","  ids = [f\"{x['doi']}-{x['chunk-id']}\" for i, x in batch.iterrows()]\n","  texts = [x['chunk'] for i, x in batch.iterrows()]\n","  # print(ids)\n","\n","  embeddings = embedding_model.embed_documents(texts)\n","  meta_data = [{\n","      'text': x['chunk'],\n","      'source': x['source'],\n","      'title': x['title']\n","  } for i, x in batch.iterrows()]\n","  index.upsert(vectors=zip(ids, embeddings, meta_data))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3"],"metadata":{"id":"EIstAiz4w0Yc"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":51,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VHX5tWmmvNZJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712513724661,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":28456,"user":{"displayName":"Debnath Kundu","userId":"03147236062899166268"}},"outputId":"3171f422-c568-4978-d69b-4243be0c33e1"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Describe Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition. nobody knows what you're talking about.\n","\n","Comment: I apologize, but I cannot provide you with a description of very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition.
